        abstract = {Despite the fact that there are various configurations of self-balanced two-wheeled machines (TWMs), the workspace of such systems is restricted by their current configurations and designs. In this work, the dynamic analysis of a novel configuration of TWMs is introduced that enables handling a payload attached to the intermediate body (IB) in two mutually perpendicular directions. This configuration will enlarge the workspace of the vehicle and increase its flexibility in material handling, objects assembly and similar industrial and service robot applications. The proposed configuration gains advantages of the design of serial arms while occupying a minimum space which is unique feature of TWMs. The proposed machine has five degrees of freedoms (DOFs) that can be useful for industrial applications such as pick and place, material handling and packaging. This machine will provide an advantage over other TWMs in terms of the wider workspace and the increased flexibility in service and industrial applications. Furthermore, the proposed design will add additional challenge of controlling the system to compensate for the change of the location of the COM due to performing tasks of handling in multiple directions.}

We describe a learning approach as a step in this direction, where we teach a humanoid robot how to play the game of noughts and crosses. Given that multiple multimodal skills can be trained to play this game, we focus our attention to training the robot to perceive the game, and to interact in this game. Our multimodal deep reinforcement learning agent perceives multimodal features and exhibits verbal and non-verbal actions while playing. Experimental results using simulations show that the robot can learn to win or draw up to 98\% of the games. A pilot test of the proposed multimodal system for the targeted game---integrating speech, vision and gestures---reports that reasonable and fluent interactions can be achieved using the proposed approach.}

In this contribution, this idea is extended to propose that an active process of memory provides the substrate for cognitive processing, particularly when considering it as fundamentally associative and from a developmental perspective. It is in this context that the claim is made that in order to solve the question of cognition, the role and function of memory must be fully resolved.}

These limits can be overcome by adding a human in the loop to provide additional information during the learning phase. In this paper, we propose a novel way to combine human inputs and reinforcement by following the Supervised Progressively Autonomous Robot Competencies (SPARC) approach. We compare this method to the principles of Interactive Reinforcement Learning as proposed by Thomaz and Breazeal. Results from a study involving 40 participants show that using SPARC increases the performance of the learning, reduces the time and number of inputs required for teaching and faces fewer errors during the learning process. These results support the use of SPARC as an efficient method to teach a robot to interact with humans.}

While this effect may intuitively appear to be present, we here describe data to provide evidence in support of this supposition. Conducting a descriptive analysis of data from a wider study, we specifically examine the effect on child performance of repeating a previously performed collaborative task with a peer robot (i.e. not an expert agent), if initial performance is low. The results generally indicate a positive effect on performance through repetition, and a number of other correlation effects that highlight the role of individual differences. This outcome provides evidence for the variable utility of repetition between individuals, but also indicates that this is driven by the individual, which can nevertheless result in performance improvements even in the context of peer-peer interactions with relatively sparse feedback.}

In order for a robot to behave in an appropriate manner over longer timescales, its behaviours should be coterminous with that of the interacting children. Generating such sustained and engaging social behaviours is an on-going research challenge, and we argue here that the recent progress of deep machine learning opens new perspectives that the HRI community should embrace. As an initial step in that direction, we propose the creation of a large open dataset of child-robot social interactions. We detail our proposed methodology for data acquisition: children interact with a robot puppeted by an expert adult during a range of playful face-to- face social tasks. By doing so, we seek to capture a rich set of human-like behaviours occurring in natural social interactions, that are explicitly mapped to the robot's embodiment and affordances.}

Though the developed prototype is developed at this stage to fit a child, it can be resized, after considering variations in weight and size, to fit an older adult. The developed prototype has a mechanism that enables the user to transform from sit-to-stand (STS) posture and vice versa. With the help of the developed wheelchair, the user will also be able to adjust the posture of his upper body using an adjustable back support using two linear actuators. This configuration will allow the user to use the wheelchair as a mobility device as well as for rehabilitation purposes without the need of external support. The availability of STS and back adjustment mechanisms will allow the user to do regular exercising which will enhance blood circulation as sitting for long periods inflates lower limbs disability. The proposed configuration will help in enhancing the functional capabilities of end-users allowing for increased independence and ultimately quality of life.}

Moreover, in the last years, high power machines, advanced technologies, higher cost for spare parts and repairing, and fuel consumption contributed to an even more higher increase of the machinery costs. Many engineering and economic methodological approaches have been implemented to calculate machinery use and cost, but they are almost confined in scientific and technical documentations making it difficult for a farmer to apply these approaches for deciding on buying, leasing, or sharing agricultural machinery.

Information and communications technology (ICT) has an increasingly important role on business processes and provides a powerful foundation to address many daily problems. Today users want to be connected to useful information in real time. To that effect, the aim of this work was to develop an easy-to-use mobile application, called ?AMACA? (Agricultural Machine App Cost Analysis) for determining the machinery cost in different field operations and making it available via a web mobile application using a cross-platform approach. The customer-driven Quality Function Deployment [QFD] approach was implemented in order to link the user expectations with the design characteristics of the app. The AMACA app is free, readily available, and does not require any installation on the end user?s device. It is a cross-platform application meaning that it operates on any device through a web interface and is supported by various browsers. The user can make subsequent calculations by varying the input parameters (fuel price, interest rate, field capacity, tractor power, etc.) and compare the results in a sensitivity analysis basis. AMACA app can support the decisions on whether to purchase a new equipment/tractor (strategic level), the use of own machinery or to hire a service, and also to select the economical appropriate cultivation system (tactical level).}

        abstract = {All complex motion patterns can be decomposed into several elements, including translation, expansion/contraction and rotational motion. In biological vision systems, scientists have found specific types of visual neurons have specific preferences to each of the three motion elements. There are computational models on translation and expansion/contraction perception, however, little has been done in the past to create computational models for rotation motion perception. To fill this gap, we proposed a neural network which utilizes a specific spatiotemporal arrangement of asymmetric lateral inhibited directional selective neural networks for rotational motion perception. The proposed neural network consists of two parts - presynaptic and postsynaptic parts. In the presynaptic part, there are a number of lateral inhibited directional selective neural networks to extract directional visual cues. In the postsynaptic part, similar to the arrangement of the directional columns in the cerebral cortex, these directional selective neurons are arranged in a cyclic order to perceive rotational motion cues. In the postsynaptic network, the delayed excitation from each directional selective neuron is multiplied by the gathered excitation from this neuron and its unilateral counterparts depending on which rotation, clockwise or counterclockwise, to perceive. Systematic experiments under various conditions and settings have been carried out and validated the robustness and reliability of the proposed neural network in detecting clockwise or counterclockwise rotational motion. This research is a critical step further towards dynamic visual information processing.}

They have recently gained a lot of attention in operations research, machine learning and policy search of robot motor skills due to their ease of use and their generality. Yet, many stochastic search algorithms require relearning if the task or objective function changes slightly to adapt the solution to the new situation or the new context. In this paper, we consider the contextual stochastic search setup. Here, we want to find multiple good parameter vectors for multiple related tasks, where each task is described by a continuous context vector. Hence, the objective function might change slightly for each parameter vector evaluation of a task or context. Contextual algorithms have been investigated in the field of policy search, however, the search distribution typically uses a parametric model that is linear in the some hand-defined context features. Finding good context features is a challenging task, and hence, non-parametric methods are often preferred over their parametric counter-parts. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric contextual stochastic search algorithm that can learn a non-parametric search distribution for multiple tasks simultaneously. In difference to existing methods, our method can also learn a context dependent covariance matrix that guides the exploration of the search process. We illustrate its performance on several non-linear contextual tasks.}

However, it typically requires a manual specification of a cost function which often contains several objectives, such as reaching goal positions at different time steps or energy efficiency. Manually trading-off these objectives is often difficult and requires a high engineering effort. In this paper, we present a new approach to specify optimal behavior. We directly specify the desired behavior by a distribution over future states or features of the states. For example, the experimenter could choose to reach certain mean positions with given accuracy/variance at specified time steps. Our approach also unifies optimal control and inverse optimal control in one framework. Given a desired state distribution, we estimate a cost function such that the optimal controller matches the desired distribution. If the desired distribution is estimated from expert demonstrations, our approach performs inverse optimal control. We evaluate our approach on several optimal and inverse optimal control tasks on non-linear systems using incremental linearizations similar to differential dynamic programming approaches.}

of social daily activities including risk situations useful to test approaches for assisted living, since this type of dataset is still missing. Results show that using a modified dynamic Bayesian mixture model designed to merge features with different semantics and also with proximity priors, the proposed framework can correctly recognize social activities in different situations, e.g. using data from one or two individuals.}

unknown systems and the associated experiment. We show that
all twelve scientists were able to replicate a formerly unknown

        abstract = {We present a lifelong mapping and localisation system for long-term autonomous operation of mobile robots in changing environments.
The core of the system is a spatio-temporal occupancy grid that explicitly represents the persistence and periodicity of the individual cells and can predict the probability of their occupancy in the future.
During navigation, our robot builds temporally local maps and integrates then into the global spatio-temporal grid. Through re-observation of the same locations, the spatio-temporal grid learns the long-term environment dynamics and gains the ability to predict the future environment states. This predictive ability allows to generate time-specific 2d maps  used by the robot's localisation and planning modules. By analysing data from a long-term deployment of the robot in a human-populated environment, we show that the proposed  representation improves localisation accuracy and the efficiency of path planning. We also show how to integrate the method into the ROS navigation stack for use by other roboticists.}

Our objective is to accurately determine which product sections a user is adjacent to while traversing the store, using RSSI readings from multiple beacons, measured asynchronously on a standard commercial mobile device. We further wish to leverage the store layout (which imposes natural constraints on the movement of users) and the physical configuration of the beacon network, to produce a robust and efficient solution. We start by describing our application context and hardware configuration, and proceed to introduce our node-graph model of user location. We then describe our experimental work which begins with an investigation of signal characteristics along and across aisles. We propose three methods of localization, using a ?nearest-beacon? approach as a base-line; exponentially averaged weighted range estimates; and a particle-filter method based on the RSSI attenuation model and Gaussian-noise. Our results demonstrate that the particle filter method significantly out-performs the others. Scalability also makes this method ideal for applications run on mobile devices with more limited computational capabilities}

Based on the semi Markov decision process setting (SMDP) and the option framework, we propose a model which aims to alleviate these concerns. Instead of learning a single monolithic policy, the agent learns a set of simpler sub-policies as well as the initiation and termination probabilities for each of those sub-policies. While existing option learning algorithms frequently require manual specification of components such as the sub-policies, we present an algorithm which infers all relevant components of the option framework from data. Furthermore, the proposed approach is based on parametric option representations and works well in combination with current policy search methods, which are particularly well suited for continuous real-world tasks. We present results on SMDPs with discrete as well as continuous state-action spaces. The results show that the presented algorithm can combine simple sub-policies to solve complex tasks and can improve learning performance on simpler tasks.}

Starting from about 60 expressions of interest submitted by international teams distributed across the world, 19 robots were eventually selected to participate in the challenge in two of the initially proposed scenarios, i.e., manipulation and terrestrial locomotion. Results highlight both the effectiveness and limitations of state of the art soft robots with respect to the selected tasks.

We use an abstraction layer to gather information from commercial domotic sensors.  Sensor events are stored using a non-relational database. Using this database, evidences are built to query a logic network about current activities. Markov Logic Networks are able to deal with uncertainty while keeping a structured knowledge. This makes them a suitable tool for ambient sensors based inference. However, in their previous application, inferences are usually made offline. Time is a relevant constrain in our system and hence logic networks are designed here accordingly. We compare in this work different engines to model a Markov Logic Network suitable for such circumstances. Results show some insights about how to design a low latency logic network and which kind of solutions should be avoided.}

In our experiments, contexts are desired walking linear speed of the gait. Current approaches for learning control parameters of biped locomotion controllers are typically only applicable for a single context. They can be used for a particular context, for example to learn a gait with highest speed, lowest energy consumption or a combination of both. The question of our research is, how can we obtain a flexible walking controller that controls the robot (near) optimally for many different contexts? We achieve the desired flexibility of the controller by applying the recently developed contextual relative entropy policy search(REPS) method which generalizes the robot walking controller for different contexts, where a context is described by a real valued vector. In this paper we also extend the contextual REPS algorithm to learn a non-linear policy instead of a linear policy over the contexts which call it RBF-REPS as it uses Radial Basis Functions. In order to validate our method, we perform three simulation experiments including a walking experiment using a simulated NAO humanoid robot. The robot learns a policy to choose the controller parameters for a continuous set of forward walking speeds.}

We use the classification results to build temporal models that can provide these priors to the classifiers. As our system gradually learns about typical patterns of human activities, the accuracy of activity classification improves, which results in even more accurate priors. Two datasets collected over several months containing hand-annotated activity in residential and office environments were chosen to evaluate the approach. Several types of temporal models were evaluated for each of these datasets. The results indicate that incremental learning of daily routines leads to a significant improvement in activity classification.}

To achieve this, we use a Bayesian temporal model based on a Qualitative Trajectory Calculus to represent the mutual navigation intent of human and robot, and translate these descriptors into sample space constraints for trajectory generation. We show how to learn these models from demonstration and evaluate our approach against standard Gaussian cost models in simulation and in real-world using a non-holonomic mobile robot.

Such a system needs to have several competencies and must be able to process different types of representations. In this article, we describe a collection of mechanisms that enable integration of heterogeneous competencies in a principled way. Central to our design is the creation of beliefs from visual and linguistic information, and the use of these beliefs for planning system behaviour to satisfy internal drives. The system is able to detect gaps in its knowledge and to plan and execute actions that provide information needed to fill these gaps. We propose a hierarchy of mechanisms which are capable of engaging in different kinds of learning interactions, e.g. those initiated by a tutor or by the system itself. We present the theory these mechanisms are build upon and an instantiation of this theory in the form of an integrated robot system. We demonstrate the operation of the system in the case of learning conceptual models of objects and their visual properties.}

        abstract = {In nature, it is an important task for animals to detect small targets which move within cluttered background. In recent years, biologists have found that a class of neurons in the lobula complex, called STMDs (small target motion detectors) which have extreme selectivity for small targets moving within visual clutter. At the same time, some researchers assert that lateral inhibition plays an important role in discriminating the motion of the target from the motion of the background, even account for many features of the tuning of higher order visual neurons. Inspired by the finding that complete lateral inhibition can only be seen when the motion of the central region is identical to the motion of the peripheral region, we propose a new lateral inhibition mechanism combined with motion velocity and direction to improve the performance of ESTMD model (elementary small target motion detector). In this paper, we will elaborate on the biological plausibility and functionality of this new lateral inhibition mechanism in small target motion detection.}

However, such speed cannot be achieved by traditional rate-based spiking neural network (SNN). Compared with spiking rate, the specific spiking timing (also called spiking pattern) may convey much more information. In this paper, by using modified rank order coding scheme, the generated absolute analog features have been encoded into the first spike wave with specific spatiotemporal structural information. An intuitive yet powerful feed-forward spiking neural network framework has been proposed, along with its own unsupervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule with dynamic post-synaptic potential threshold. Compared with other state-of-art spiking algorithms, the proposed method uses biologically plausible STDP learning method to learn the selectivity while the dynamic post-synaptic potential threshold guarantees no training sample will be ignored during the learning procedure. Furthermore, unlike the complicated frameworks used in those state-of-art spiking algorithms, the proposed intuitive spiking neural network is not time-consuming and quite capable of on-line learning. A satisfactory experimental result has been achieved on classic MNIST handwritten character database.}

In this paper, an integrated collision predication system is proposed based on neural subsystems inspired from Lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) and directional selective neurons (DSNs) which focus on different part of the visual field separately. The two type of neurons found in the visual pathways of insects respond most strongly to moving objects with preferred motion patterns, i.e., the LGMD prefers looming stimuli and DSNs prefer specific lateral movements. We fuse the extracted information by each type of neurons to make final decision. By dividing the whole field of view into four regions for each subsystem to process, the proposed approaches can detect hazardous situations that had been difficult for single subsystem only. Our experiments show that the integrated system works in most of the hazardous scenarios.}

Therefore we consider the contextual stochastic search setup. Here, we want to find good parameter vectors for multiple related tasks, where each task is described by a continuous context vector.

In this research, we investigate the contextual stochastic search algorithms that can learn from multiple tasks simultaneously.}

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective pansharpening methods combing guided filtering and hyperspherical color transformation (HCT) for WorldView-2 images. We use panchromatic image as the guidance to further refine the intensity of multispectral data and also to extract the sufficient details from the panchromatic image itself. Moreover, the guided filtering and HCT integrated scheme can inject the extracted details into the multispectral data and the multispectral images can be sharpened all at once with an arbitrary order. The experimental results show that our proposed method can obtain high-quality pansharpened results and outperforms some existing methods.}

A grasping experimental paradigm was set up for analyzing the grasping mechanism of the human hand in daily living. The movement relationship among joints in a digit, among digits in the human hand, and the postural synergic characteristic of the fingers were studied during the grasping. The design principle of the anthropomorphic mechanical digit that can reproduce the digit grasping movement of the human hand was developed. The design theory of the kinematic transmission mechanism that can be embedded into the palm of the anthropomorphic hand to reproduce the postural synergic characteristic of the fingers by using a limited number of actuators is proposed. The design method of the anthropomorphic hand for replicating human grasping functions was formulated. Grasping experiments are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design method of the anthropomorphic hand. {\^A}{\copyright} 2016 IEEE.}

The CNN is driven by both conventional image frames and dynamic vision sensor "frames" that consist of a constant number of DAVIS ON and OFF events. The network is thus "data driven" at a sample rate proportional to the scene activity, so the effective sample rate varies from 15 Hz to 240 Hz depending on the robot speeds. The network generates four outputs: steer right, left, center and non-visible. After off-line training on labeled data, the network is imported on the on-board Summit XL robot which runs jAER and receives steering directions in real time. Successful results on closed-loop trials, with accuracies up to 87\% or 92\% (depending on evaluation criteria) are reported. Although the proposed approach discards the precise DAVIS event timing, it offers the significant advantage of compatibility with conventional deep learning technology without giving up the advantage of datadriven computing.}

The method takes advantage of the guided filter to refine the blocking edges in the upscaled multispectral images and extract sufficient high frequency details from the panchromatic image. Moreover, it can be implemented to sharpen multispectral imagery in a convenient band-by-band manner. The experimental evaluations are carried out on QuickBird satellite images. Subjective and objective evaluations show that our proposed method can achieve high spectral and spatial quality and outperforms some existing methods.}

        abstract = {Many reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, especially in robotics, consist of multiple sub-tasks that
are strongly structured. Such task structures can be exploited by incorporating hierarchical policies
that consist of gating networks and sub-policies. However, this concept has only been partially explored
for real world settings and complete methods, derived from first principles, are needed. Real
world settings are challenging due to large and continuous state-action spaces that are prohibitive
for exhaustive sampling methods. We define the problem of learning sub-policies in continuous
state action spaces as finding a hierarchical policy that is composed of a high-level gating policy to
select the low-level sub-policies for execution by the agent. In order to efficiently share experience
with all sub-policies, also called inter-policy learning, we treat these sub-policies as latent variables
which allows for distribution of the update information between the sub-policies. We present three
different variants of our algorithm, designed to be suitable for a wide variety of real world robot
learning tasks and evaluate our algorithms in two real robot learning scenarios as well as several
simulations and comparisons.}

Here, a statistical methodology is adopted which provides the engineer with a trade-off between correct detection and false-alarm rates, thereby informing decision making at the design stage.

It takes advantage of both the active pixel sensor (APS) frame and dynamic vision sensor (DVS) event outputs from the DAVIS. The tracking is performed in a three step-manner: regions of interest (ROIs) are generated by a cluster-based tracking using the DVS output, likely target locations are detected by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the APS output to classify the ROIs as foreground and background, and finally a particle filter infers the target location from the ROIs. Doing convolution only in the ROIs boosts the speed by a factor of 70 compared with full-frame convolutions for the 240x180 frame input from the DAVIS. The tracking accuracy on a predator and prey robot database reaches 90\% with a cost of less than 20ms/frame in Matlab on a normal PC without using a GPU.}

framework for data driven movement generation that has been
successfully applied for learning from demonstrations and robot
reinforcement learning. In robotics we often want to solve a
multitude of different, but related tasks. As the parameters
of the primitives are typically high dimensional, a common
practice for the generalization of movement primitives to new
tasks is to adapt only a small set of control variables, also
called meta parameters, of the primitive. Yet, for most MP
representations, the encoding of these control variables is precoded
in the representation and can not be adapted to the
considered tasks. In this paper, we want to learn the encoding of
task-specific control variables also from data instead of relying
on fixed meta-parameter representations. We use hierarchical
Bayesian models (HBMs) to estimate a low dimensional latent
variable model for probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs),
which is a recent movement primitive representation. We show
on two real robot datasets that ProMPs based on HBMs
outperform standard ProMPs in terms of generalization and
learning from a small amount of data and also allows for an
intuitive analysis of the movement. We also extend our HBM by
a mixture model, such that we can model different movement
types in the same dataset.}

Rather than using a fixed probability value, the method models the uncertainty of the elementary environment states by their frequency spectra. This allows to integrate sparse and irregular observations obtained during long-term deployments of mobile robots into memory-efficient spatio-temporal models that reflect mid- and long-term pseudo-periodic environment variations. The frequency-enhanced spatio-temporal models allow to predict the future environment states, which improves the efficiency of mobile robot operation in changing environments.   In a series of experiments performed over periods of weeks to years, we demonstrate that the proposed approach improves mobile robot localization, path and task planning, activity recognition and allows for life-long spatio-temporal exploration.}

Typically, the long-term performance of state estimation algorithms for mobile robots is evaluated using pre-recorded sensory datasets. However such datasets are not suitable for evaluating decision-making and control  algorithms where the behaviour of the robot will be different in every trial. Simulation allows to overcome this issue and while it ensures repeatability of experiments, the development of 3D simulations for an extended period of time is a costly exercise.
In our approach long-term datasets comprising high-level tracks of dynamic entities such as people and furniture are recorded by ambient sensors placed in a real environment. The high-level tracks are then used to parameterise a 3D  simulation containing its own geometric models of the dynamic entities and the background scene. This simulation,  which is based on actual human activities, can then be used to benchmark and validate algorithms for long-term  operation of mobile robots.}

Previous work in this area has often identified distinctive prosodic features, or features relating to syntactic or semantic completeness, as marking appropriate places of turn-taking. In a separate strand of work, psycholinguistic studies have established a connection between information density and prominence in language{--}the less expected a linguistic unit is in a particular context, the more likely it is to be linguistically marked. This has been observed across linguistic levels, including the prosodic, which plays an important role in predicting overlapping speech.

In this article, we explore the hypothesis that information density (ID) also plays a role in turn-taking. Specifically, we aim to show that humans are sensitive to the peaks and troughs of information density in speech, and that overlapping speech at ID troughs is perceived as more acceptable than overlaps at ID peaks. To test our hypothesis, we collect human ratings for three models of generating overlapping speech based on features of: (1) prosody and semantic or syntactic completeness, (2) information density, and (3) both types of information. Results show that over 50\% of users preferred the version using both types of features, followed by a preference for information density features alone. This indicates a clear human sensitivity to the effects of information density in spoken language and provides a strong motivation to adopt this metric for the design, development and evaluation of turn-taking modules in spoken and incremental dialogue systems.}

The studies in biology revealed that environment is a preeminent factor in especially cue-based aggregation that can be defined as aggregation at a particular location which is a heat or a light source acting as a cue indicating an optimal zone. In swarm robotics, studies on cue-based aggregation mainly focused on different methods of aggregation and different parameters such as population size. Although of utmost importance, environmental effects on aggregation performance have not been studied systematically. In this paper, we study the effects of different environmental factors; size, texture and number of cues in a static setting and moving cues in a dynamic setting using real robots. We used aggregation time and size of the aggregate as the two metrics to measure aggregation performance. We performed real robot experiments with different population sizes and evaluated the performance of aggregation using the defined metrics. We also proposed a probabilistic aggregation model and predicted the aggregation performance accurately in most of the settings. The results of the experiments show that environmental conditions affect the aggregation performance considerably and have to be studied in depth.}

methods often depend on the quality of the given datasets, which are not
trivial to obtain with sufficient quality. Although reinforcement learning
approaches have been recently used to achieve autonomous collection
of grasp datasets, the existing algorithms are often limited to specific
grasp types. In this paper, we present a framework for hierarchical reinforcement
learning of grasping policies. In our framework, the lowerlevel
hierarchy learns multiple grasp types, and the upper-level hierarchy
learns a policy to select from the learned grasp types according to a point
cloud of a new object. Through experiments, we validate that our approach
learns grasping by constructing the grasp dataset autonomously.
The experimental results show that our approach learns multiple grasping
policies and generalizes the learned grasps by using local point cloud
information.}

A major constraint with this technique is the need to use a radially symmetric stimulus, such as Gaussian white noise. Natural visual stimuli are required to generate a more realistic ganglion-cell model. However, natural visual stimuli significantly differ from white noise stimuli and are not radially symmetric. Therefore a more sophisticated modelling approach than the linear-nonlinear method is required for modelling ganglion cells stimulated with natural images. Machine learning algorithms have proved very capable in modelling complex non-linear systems in other scientific domains. In this paper, we report on the development of computational models, using different machine learning regression algorithms, that model retinal ganglion cells stimulated with natural images in order to predict the number of spikes elicited. Neuronal recordings obtained from electro-physiological experiments in which isolated salamander retinas are stimulated with static natural images are used to develop these models. In order to compare the performance of the machine learning models, a linear-nonlinear model was also developed from separate experiments using Gaussian white noise stimuli. A comparison of the spike prediction using the models developed shows that the machine learning models perform better than the linear-nonlinear approach.}

It has been argued however, that artificial stimuli are generally not complex enough to encapsulate the full complexity of a visual scene?s stimuli and thus any model formulated under these conditions can only be considered to emulate a subset of the biological model. In this paper, we present an investigation into the use of natural images to refine the size of the receptive fields, where their initial location and shape have been pre-determined through reverse correlation. We present findings that show the use of natural images to determine the receptive field size provides a significant improvement over the standard approach for determining the receptive field.}

        abstract = {Traditionally, it has been assumed that the important information from a visual scene is encoded within the average firing rate of a retinal ganglion cell. Many modelling techniques thus focus solely on estimating a firing rate rather than a cells temporal response. It has been argued however that the latter is more important, as intricate details of the visual scene are stored within the temporal nature of the code. In this paper, we present a model that accurately describes the input/output response of a retinal ganglion cell in terms of its temporal coding. The approach borrows a concept of layout from popular implementations, such as the linearnonlinear Poisson method that produces an estimated spike rate prior to generating a spiking output. Using the wellknown Izhikevich neuron as the spike generator and various approaches for spike rate estimation, we show that the resulting overall system predicts a retinal ganglion cells response to novel stimuli in terms of bursting and periods of silence with reasonable accuracy.}

From this, a series of practical rec- ommendations based on rigorous guidelines from other research fields that have not yet become common practice in HRI are proposed. Furthermore, we explore the primary implications of the observed recent trends for the field more generally, in terms of both methodology and research directions.We propose that the interdisciplinary nature of HRI must be maintained, but that a common methodological approach provides a much needed frame of reference to facilitate rigorous future progress.}

There are further some indications from the literature that there is an association between personality dimensions and various aspects of educational behaviour and performance. This brief contribution seeks to explore the single personality dimension of extroversion/introversion: specifically, how children rate them- selves with a validated questionnaire in comparison to how teachers rate them using a relative scale. In an exploratory study conducted in a primary school, we find a non-significant association between these two ratings. We suggest that this mismatch is related to the context in which the respective ratings were made. In order to facilitate generalisation of personality- related results across studies, we propose two general reporting recommendations. Based on our results, we suggest that the application of personality assessments in a child-robot interaction context may be more complex than initially envisaged, with some dependence on context.}

increasingly exploring the use of social robots for educating children. Commonly, non-academic audiences will ask how robots compare to humans in terms of learning outcomes. This question is also interesting for social roboticists as humans are often assumed to be an upper benchmark for social behaviour, which influences learning. This paper presents a study in which learning gains of children are compared when taught the same math- ematics material by a robot tutor and a non-expert human tutor. Significant learning occurs in both conditions, but the children improve more with the human tutor. This difference is not statistically significant, but the effect sizes fall in line with findings from other literature showing that humans outperform technology for tutoring. We discuss these findings in the context of applying social robots in child education.}

In this paper, we examine the impact of providing a robot with learning capabilities on how users report the quality of the interaction in relation to objective performance. We show that humans tend to prefer interacting with a learning robot and will rate its capabilities higher even if the actual performance in the task was lower. We suggest that adding learning to a robot could reduce the apparent load felt by a user for a new task and improve the user?s evaluation of the system, thus facilitating the integration of such robots into existing work flows}

Both human-human and human- robot interaction literature predicts an increase in learning with increased social availability of a tutor, where social availability has verbal and nonverbal components. Prior work has shown that greater availability in the nonverbal behaviour of a robot tutor has a positive impact on child learning. This paper presents a study with 67 children to explore how social aspects of a tutor robot?s speech influences their perception of the robot and their language learning in an interaction. Children perceive the difference in social behaviour between ?low? and ?high? verbal availability conditions, and improve significantly between a pre- and a post-test in both conditions. A longer-term retention test taken the following week showed that the children had retained almost all of the information they had learnt. However, learning was not affected by which of the robot behaviours they had been exposed to. It is suggested that in this short-term interaction context, additional effort in developing social aspects of a robot?s verbal behaviour may not return the desired positive impact on learning gains.}

Effectively reproducing such spatiotemporal feature of hand configuration trajectory in real time is essential to understand the human motor control and plan human-like motion on anthropomorphic robotic arm. However, there are no novel computational models in literature toward reproducing hand configuration-to-configuration movement in spatiotemporal profile. In response to the problem, this paper presents a computational framework for hand configuration trajectory formation based on hierarchical principle of human motor control. The composite potential field is constructed on special Euclidean Group to induce time-varying configuration toward target. The dynamic behavior of hand is described by a second-order kinematic model to produce the external representation of high-level motor control. The multivariate regression relation between intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates of arm, is statistically analyzed for determining the arm orientation in real time, which produces the external representation of low-level motor control. The proposed method is demonstrated in an anthropomorphic arm by performing several highly curved self-reaching movements. The generated configuration trajectories are compared with actual human movement in spatiotemporal profile to validate the proposed method.}

By using a functional modeling methodology, the structural representations of the systems, in terms of activities, actions, processes, and operations, were generated and implemented by the ExtendSim? simulation software. It was shown that the models can identify the bottlenecks of the systems and can be further used as a decision support system by testing various alternatives, in terms of the resources used and their dimensioning. Finally, the models were evaluated against the sensitivity on input parameters which are known with a level of uncertainty, i.e. the expected yield and the expected machinery performance.}

Consequently, it places prediction and priming on the basis of prior experience to be inherent and fundamental aspects of processing. Social interaction is taken here to minimally require contingent and co-adaptive behaviours from the interacting parties. In this contribution, I seek to show how the memory-centred cognition approach to cognitive architectures can provide an means of addressing these functions. A number of example implementations are briefly reviewed, particularly focusing on multi-modal alignment as a function of experience-based priming. While there is further refinement required to the theory, and implementations based thereon, this approach provides an interesting alternative perspective on the foundations of cognitive architectures to support robots engage in social interactions with humans.}

        abstract = {Specifying a numeric reward function for reinforcement learning typically requires a lot of hand-tuning from a human expert. In contrast, preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) utilizes only pairwise comparisons between trajectories as a feedback signal, which are often more intuitive to specify. Currently available approaches to PBRL for control problems with continuous state/action spaces require a known or estimated model, which is often not available and hard to learn. In this paper, we integrate preference-based estimation of the reward function into a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, resulting in a model-free PBRL algorithm. Our new algorithm is based on Relative Entropy Policy Search (REPS), enabling us to utilize stochastic policies and to directly control the greediness of the policy update. REPS decreases exploration of the policy slowly by limiting the relative entropy of the policy update, which ensures that the algorithm is provided with a versatile set of trajectories, and consequently with informative preferences. The preference-based estimation is computed using a sample-based Bayesian method, which can also estimate the uncertainty of the utility. Additionally, we also compare to a linear solvable approximation, based on inverse RL. We show that both approaches perform favourably to the current state-of-the-art. The overall result is an algorithm that can learn non-parametric continuous action policies from a small number of preferences.}

Bounding squares containing targets were then extracted, resized to a fixed size and used to construct a large standard database called Pest ID. This database was then utilized for self-learning of local image features which were, in turn, used for classification by DCNN. DCNN learning optimized the critical parameters, including size, number and convolutional stride of local receptive fields, dropout ratio and the final loss function. To demonstrate the practical utility of using DCNN, we explored different architectures by shrinking depth and width and found effective sizes that can act as alternatives for practical applications. On the test set of paddy field images, our architectures achieved a mean Accuracy Precision (mAP) of 0.951, a significant improvement over previous methods.}

Web of Science was used to search titles of English articles from 2007?2015 for a range of synonymous words concerning participation rates. A predefined inclusion criteria was used to determine whether the resulting articles referred to participation in the context of study enrolment. Factors associated with participation were extracted from included articles. The search returned 626 articles, of which 162 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Compared with pre-2007, participant characteristics generally remained unchanged, but were topic-dependent. An increased focus on study design and a greater use of technology for enrolment and data collection was found, suggesting a transition towards technology-based methods. In addition to increased participation rates, studies should consider any bias arising from non-participation. When reporting results, authors are encouraged to include a standardised participation rate, a calculation of potential bias, and to apply an appropriate statistical method where appropriate. Requirements from journals to include these would allow for easier comparison of results between studies.}

of use and their generality, they have recently also gained a lot of attention in operations
research, machine learning and policy search. Yet, these algorithms require
a lot of evaluations of the objective, scale poorly with the problem dimension, are
affected by highly noisy objective functions and may converge prematurely. To
alleviate these problems, we introduce a new surrogate-based stochastic search
approach. We learn simple, quadratic surrogate models of the objective function.
As the quality of such a quadratic approximation is limited, we do not greedily exploit
the learned models. The algorithm can be misled by an inaccurate optimum
introduced by the surrogate. Instead, we use information theoretic constraints to
bound the ?distance? between the new and old data distribution while maximizing
the objective function. Additionally the new method is able to sustain the exploration
of the search distribution to avoid premature convergence. We compare our
method with state of art black-box optimization methods on standard uni-modal
and multi-modal optimization functions, on simulated planar robot tasks and a
complex robot ball throwing task. The proposed method considerably outperforms
the existing approaches.}

        abstract = {Social robots have the potential to provide support in a number of practical domains, such as learning and behaviour change. This potential is particularly relevant for children, who have proven receptive to interactions with social robots. To reach learning and therapeutic goals, a number of issues need to be investigated, notably the design of an effective child-robot interaction (cHRI) to ensure the child remains engaged in the relationship and that educational goals are met. Typically, current cHRI research experiments focus on a single type of interaction activity (e.g. a game). However, these can suffer from a lack of adaptation to the child, or from an increasingly repetitive nature of the activity and interaction. In this paper, we motivate and propose a practicable solution to this issue: an adaptive robot able to switch between multiple activities within single interactions. We describe a system that embodies this idea, and present a case study in which diabetic children collaboratively learn with the robot about various aspects of managing their condition. We demonstrate the ability of our system to induce a varied interaction and show the potential of this approach both as an educational tool and as a research method for long-term cHRI.}

        abstract = {The interactive ArgTrust application is a decision-making tool that is based on an underlying formal system of argumentation in which the evidence that influences a recommendation, or conclusion, is modulated according to values of trust that the user places in that evidence. This paper presents the design and analysis of a user study which was intended to evaluate the effectiveness of ArgTrust in a collaborative human?agent decision-making task. The results show that users? interactions with ArgTrust helped them consider their decisions more carefully than without using the software tool.}

        abstract = {In nature, it is an important task for animals to detect small targets which move within cluttered background. In recent years, biologists have found that a class of neurons in the lobula complex, called STMDs (small target motion detectors) which have extreme selectivity for small targets moving within visual clutter. At the same time, some researchers assert that lateral inhibition plays an important role in discriminating the motion of the target from the motion of the background , even account for many features of the tuning of higher order visual neurons. Inspired by the finding that complete lateral inhibition can only be seen when the motion of the central region is identical to the motion of the peripheral region, we propose a new lateral inhibition mechanism combined with motion velocity and direction to improve the performance of ESTMD model (elementary small target motion detector). In this paper, we will elaborate on the biological plausibility and functionality of this new lateral inhibition mechanism in small target motion
detection.}
