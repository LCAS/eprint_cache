        abstract = {The extraordinary manipulation capabilities of the octopus arm generate a big interest in the robotics community. Many researchers have put a big effort in the design, modelling and control of continuum manipulators inspired by the octopus arm. New mathematical tools could be introduced in the robotics community and new sources of inspiration are needed in order to simplify the use of the continuum manipulator. A geometrical exact approach for direct model and a Jacobian method for the inverse model are implemented for a continuum manipulator driven by cables. The first experimental results show an average tip error of less than 6\% of the manipulator length, and a good numerical performance to solve the inverse kinetics model.}

The Adaptive Strategies for Sustainable Long-Term Social Interaction (ALIZ-E) project focuses on the design of long-term, adaptive social interaction between robots and child users in real-world settings. In this paper, we report on the iterative approach taken to scientific and technical developments toward this goal: advancing individual technical competencies and integrating them to form an autonomous robotic system for evaluation ?in the wild.? The first evaluation iterations have shown the potential of this methodology in terms of adaptation of the robot to the interactant and the resulting influences on engagement. This sets the foundation for an ongoing research program that seeks to develop technologies for social robot companions.}

Two alternative imaging technologies are investigated; laser scatter imaging and polarised light stress images. After segmenting the seal area from the rest of the respective image, a classifier is trained to detect faults in different regions of the seal area using features extracted from the pixels in the respective region. A very large set of candidate features, based on statistical information relating to the colour and texture of each region, is first extracted. Then an adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) is used to automatically select the best features for discriminating faults from non-faults. With this approach, different features can be selected and optimised for the different imaging methods. In experiments we compare the performance of classifiers trained using features extracted from laser scatter images only, polarised light stress images only, and a combination of both image types. The results show that the polarised light and laser scatter classifiers achieved accuracies of 96{$\backslash$}\% and 90{$\backslash$}\%, respectively, while the combination of both sensors achieved an accuracy of 95{$\backslash$}\%. These figures suggest that both systems have potential for commercial development.}

In this article, we propose a biologically motivated computational model to track and detect the objects contour. Even the previous research has proposed some models by using the Dijkstra algorithm 1, our work is to mimic the human eye movement and imitate saccades in our humans. We use natural images with associated ground truth contour maps to assess the performance of the proposed operator regarding the detection of contours while suppressing texture edges.

This endeavours demand for appropriate models and methodologies to represent JSB and facilitate its analysis. In this paper, we adopt a qualitative trajectory calculus (QTC) as a formal foundation for the analysis and representation of such spatial behaviour of a human and a robot based on a compact encoding of the relative trajectories of two interacting agents in a sequential model. We present this QTC together with a distance measure and a probabilistic behaviour model and outline its usage in an actual JSB study.We argue that the proposed QTC coding scheme and derived methodologies for analysis and modelling are flexible and extensible to be adapted for a variety of other scenarios and studies.

Self-mapping in wireless sensor network which enables beacon-based systems to build a node map on-the-fly extends the range of the sensor network's applications. A variety of self-mapping algorithms have been developed for the sensor networks. Some algorithms assume no information and estimate only the relative location of the sensor nodes. In this paper, we assume a very small percentage of the sensor nodes aware of their own locations, so the proposed algorithm estimates other node's absolute location using the distance differences. In particular, time difference of arrival (TDOA) technology is adopted to obtain the distance difference. The obtained time difference accuracy is 10ns which corresponds to a distance difference error of 3m. We evaluate self-mapping's accuracy with a small number of seed nodes. Overall, the accuracy and the coverage are shown to be comparable to those achieved results with other technologies and algorithms. {\^A}{\copyright} 2012 IEEE.}

However, the use of conventional engineering approaches to control soft robots is difficult, especially to achieve autonomous behaviors. With its completely soft body, the octopus has a rich behavioral repertoire, so it is frequently used as a model in building and controlling soft robots. However, the sensorimotor control strategies in some interesting behaviors of the octopus, such as octopus crawling, remain largely unknown. In this study, we review related biological studies on octopus crawling behavior and propose its sensorimotor control strategy. The proposed strategy is implemented with an echo state network on an octopus-inspired, multi-arm crawling robot. We also demonstrate the control strategy in the robot for autonomous direction and speed control. Finally, the implications of this study are discussed.}

Specifically, a central platform lodges six silicone limbs, radially distributed, with cables embedded. A new mechanism-specific gait, invariant regarding the number of limbs, has been implemented. Functionally, some limbs provide stability while others push and pull the robot to locomote in the desired direction. Once the robot is close to a target, one limb is elected to wrap around the object and, thanks to the particular limb structure and the soft material, a friction-based grasping is achieved. The robot is inspired by the octopus and implements the key principles of locomotion in this animal, without coping the full body structure. For this reason it works in water, but it is not restricted to this environment. The experiments show the effectiveness of the original solution in locomotion and grasping.}

In this paper a direct and inverse kinetics models are described for a non-constant curvature structure. A major effort has been put recently in modelling and controlling constant curvature structures, such as cylindrical shaped manipulators. Manipulators with non-constant curvature, on the other hand, have been treated with a piecewise constant curvature approximation. In this work a non-constant curvature manipulator with a conical shape is built, taking inspiration from the anatomy of the octopus arm. The choice of a conical shape manipulator made of soft material is justified by its enhanced capability in grasping objects of different sizes. A different approach from the piecewise constant curvature approximation is employed for direct and inverse kinematics model. A continuum geometrically exact approach for direct kinetics model and a Jacobian method for inverse case are proposed. They are validated experimentally with a prototype soft robot arm moving in water. Results show a desired tip position in the task-space can be achieved automatically with a satisfactory degree of accuracy.}

These features provide a richer description of the co-occurrence matrix, and can be exploited to obtain stronger classification results, especially when smaller portions of the image are considered. This is extremely useful for crowd localisation: acquired images are divided into smaller regions in order to perform a classification on each one. A thorough evaluation of the proposed system on a real world data set is also presented: this validates the improvements in reliability of the crowd detection and localisation.}

        abstract = {Memory may be broadly regarded as information gained from past experi- ence which is available in the service of ongoing and future adaptive behavior. The biological implementation ofmemory shares little with memory in synthetic cognitive systems where it is typically regarded as a passive storage structure. Neurophysiological evidence indicates that memory is neither passive nor cen- tralised. A review of the relevant literature in the biological and computer sciences is conducted and a novel methodology is applied that incorporates neuroethological approaches with general biological inspiration in the design of synthetic cognitive systems: a case study regarding episodic memory provides an illustration of the utility of this methodology. As a consequence of applying this approach to the reinterpretation of the implementation of memory in syn- thetic systems, four fundamental functional principles are derived that are in accordance with neuroscientific theory, and which may be applied to the design of more adaptive and robust synthetic cognitive systems: priming, cross-modal associations, cross-modal coordination without semantic information transfer, and global system behavior resulting from activation dynamics within the mem- ory system.}

The control board sends up to six signals to the limbs, which mechanically perform a stereotypical rhythmical movement.

        abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction problems can be solved by finding the minimizer of a suitable objective function. The objective function usually consists of a data fidelity term and a regularization term. Total variation (TV) minimization problems are widely used for solving incomplete data problems in CT image reconstruction. In this paper, we focus on the CT image reconstruction model which combines the TV regularization and ?1 data error term. We introduce a primal dual proximal point method of Chambolle-Pock algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem. We tested it on computer simulated data and the experiment results shown it exhibited good performance when used to few-view CT image reconstruction. {\copyright} 2012 IEEE.}

        abstract = {This paper reports the performance and effect of diverse keystroke features combination on keystroke dynamic authentication system by using fusion scheme. First of all, four types of keystroke features are acquired from our collected dataset, later then transformed into similarity scores by the use of Gaussian Probability Density Function (GPD) and Direction Similarity Measure (DSM). Next, three fusion schemes are introduced to merge the scores pairing with six fusion rules. Result shows that the finest performance is obtained by the combination of both dwell time and flight time collectively. Finally, this experiment also investigates the effect of using larger dataset on performance, which turns out to be rather consistent. {\^A}{\copyright} 2012 IEEE.}

        abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a top-down motion tracking model to detect the attention region. Many biological inspired systems have been studied and most of them are consisted by bottom-up mechanisms and top-down processes. Top-down attention is guided by task-driven information that is acquired through learning procedures. Our model improves the top-down mechanisms by using a probability map (PM). The PM follows to track if all the potential locations of targets based on the information contained in the frame sequences. By using this, PM can be regarded as a short term memory for attended saliency regions. This function is similar to the dorsal stream of V1 primary area. The semi-learning model constructs an efficient mechanism for attention detection to simulate the eye movements and fixations in our human visual systems. Generally, our work is to mimic human visual systems and it will further be applied on the robotics platform. From the random selected video clips, our performances are better than other state-of-the-art approaches. {\^A}{\copyright} 2012 IEEE.}
