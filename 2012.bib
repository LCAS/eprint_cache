        abstract = {The extraordinary manipulation capabilities of the octopus arm generate a big interest in the robotics community. Many researchers have put a big effort in the design, modelling and control of continuum manipulators inspired by the octopus arm. New mathematical tools could be introduced in the robotics community and new sources of inspiration are needed in order to simplify the use of the continuum manipulator. A geometrical exact approach for direct model and a Jacobian method for the inverse model are implemented for a continuum manipulator driven by cables. The first experimental results show an average tip error of less than 6\% of the manipulator length, and a good numerical performance to solve the inverse kinetics model.}

problem that is difficult to tackle using hand-coded programs.
In this paper we present an imitation learning approach for
learning and generalizing grasping skills based on human
demonstrations. To this end, we split the task of synthesizing
a grasping motion into three parts: (1) learning efficient grasp
representations from human demonstrations, (2) warping contact
points onto new objects, and (3) optimizing and executing
the reach-and-grasp movements. We learn low-dimensional
latent grasp spaces for different grasp types, which form the
basis for a novel extension to dynamic motor primitives. These
latent-space dynamic motor primitives are used to synthesize
entire reach-and-grasp movements. We evaluated our method
on a real humanoid robot. The results of the experiment
demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our approach.}

The first evaluation iterations have shown the potential of this methodology in terms of adaptation of the robot to the interactant and the resulting influences on engagement.

        abstract = {Since the strict separation of working spaces of humans and robots has experienced a softening due to recent robotics research achievements, close interaction of humans and robots comes rapidly into reach. In this context, physical human?robot interaction raises a number of questions regarding a desired intuitive robot behavior. The continuous bilateral information and energy exchange requires an appropriate continuous robot feedback. Investigating a cooperative manipulation task, the desired behavior is a combination of an urge to fulfill the task, a smooth instant reactive behavior to human force inputs and an assignment of the task effort to the cooperating agents. In this paper, a formal analysis of human?robot cooperative load transport is presented. Three different possibilities for the assignment of task effort are proposed. Two proposed dynamic role exchange mechanisms adjust the robot?s urge to complete the task based on the human feedback. For comparison, a static role allocation strategy not relying on the human agreement feedback is investigated as well. All three role allocation mechanisms are evaluated in a user study that involves large-scale kinesthetic interaction and full-body human motion. Results show tradeoffs between subjective and objective performance measures stating a clear objective advantage of the proposed dynamic role allocation scheme.}

skills in order to reduce their reliance on human programming.
Many motor skill learning methods concentrate
on learning a single solution for a given task. However, discarding
information about additional solutions during learning
unnecessarily limits autonomy. Such favoring of single solutions
often requires re-learning of motor skills when the task, the
environment or the robot?s body changes in a way that renders
the learned solution infeasible. Future robots need to be able to
adapt to such changes and, ideally, have a large repertoire of
movements to cope with such problems. In contrast to current
methods, our approach simultaneously learns multiple distinct
solutions for the same task, such that a partial degeneration of
this solution space does not prevent the successful completion
of the task. In this paper, we present a complete framework
that is capable of learning different solution strategies for a
real robot Tetherball task.}

Two alternative imaging technologies are investigated; laser scatter imaging and polarised light stress images. After segmenting the seal area from the rest of the respective image, a classifier is trained to detect faults in different regions of the seal area using features extracted from the pixels in the respective region. A very large set of candidate features, based on statistical information relating to the colour and texture of each region, is first extracted. Then an adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) is used to automatically select the best features for discriminating faults from non-faults. With this approach, different features can be selected and optimised for the different imaging methods. In experiments we compare the performance of classifiers trained using features extracted from laser scatter images only, polarised light stress images only, and a combination of both image types. The results show that the polarised light and laser scatter classifiers achieved accuracies of 96{$\backslash$}\% and 90{$\backslash$}\%, respectively, while the combination of both sensors achieved an accuracy of 95{$\backslash$}\%. These figures suggest that both systems have potential for commercial development.}

We use natural images with associated ground truth contour maps to assess the performance of the proposed operator regarding the detection of contours while suppressing texture edges.

We present this QTC together with a distance measure and a probabilistic behaviour model and outline its usage in an actual JSB study.We argue that the proposed QTC coding scheme and derived methodologies for analysis and modelling are flexible and extensible to be adapted for a variety of other scenarios and studies.

Self-mapping in wireless sensor network which enables beacon-based systems to build a node map on-the-fly extends the range of the sensor network's applications. A variety of self-mapping algorithms have been developed for the sensor networks. Some algorithms assume no information and estimate only the relative location of the sensor nodes. In this paper, we assume a very small percentage of the sensor nodes aware of their own locations, so the proposed algorithm estimates other node's absolute location using the distance differences. In particular, time difference of arrival (TDOA) technology is adopted to obtain the distance difference. The obtained time difference accuracy is 10ns which corresponds to a distance difference error of 3m. We evaluate self-mapping's accuracy with a small number of seed nodes. Overall, the accuracy and the coverage are shown to be comparable to those achieved results with other technologies and algorithms. {\^A}{\copyright} 2012 IEEE.}

This model compares various two- and three-dimensional soil cutting models to determine the most applicable model to legged locomotion in deformable soils, and is flexible to use any of these models depending on the leg shape, sinkage and other conditions. This baseline draught force model is used for determining the soil forces available for legged vehicle locomotion, as well as the soil thrust available to the vehicle footprint. Empirical investigations were performed with a robotic arm in planetary soil simulants to validate a legged mobility model through determination of the draft force of a robotic leg pushing through soil at constant and varying sinkage levels. The resulting locomotion performance model will be used to predict the ability of the legged vehicle to traverse a specific soil. An introduction to the planetary soil simulants used in this study (SSC-1 quartz-based sand and SSC-2 garnet-based sand) and the process used to determine their mechanical properties is also briefly presented to provide a baseline for this research.}

        abstract = {Soft robots have significant advantages over traditional rigid robots because of their morphological flexibility. However, the use of conventional engineering approaches to control soft robots is difficult, especially to achieve autonomous behaviors. With its completely soft body, the octopus has a rich behavioral repertoire, so it is frequently used as a model in building and controlling soft robots. However, the sensorimotor control strategies in some interesting behaviors of the octopus, such as octopus crawling, remain largely unknown. In this study, we review related biological studies on octopus crawling behavior and propose its sensorimotor control strategy. The proposed strategy is implemented with an echo state network on an octopus-inspired, multi-arm crawling robot. We also demonstrate the control strategy in the robot for autonomous direction and speed control. Finally, the implications of this study are discussed.}

        abstract = {An active research goal for human-computer interaction is to allow humans to communicate with computers in an intuitive and natural fashion, especially in real-life interaction scenarios. One approach that has been advocated to achieve this has been to build computer systems with human-like qualities and capabilities. In this paper, we present insight on how human-computer interaction can be enriched by employing the computers with behavioral patterns that naturally appear in human-human negotiation scenarios. For this purpose, we introduce a two-party negotiation game specifically built for studying the effectiveness of haptic and audio-visual cues in conveying negotiation related behaviors. The game is centered around a real-time continuous two-party negotiation scenario based on the existing game-theory and negotiation literature. During the game, humans are confronted with a computer opponent, which can display different behaviors, such as concession, competition, and negotiation. Through a user study, we show that the behaviors that are associated with human negotiation can be incorporated into human-computer interaction, and the addition of haptic cues provides a statistically significant increase in the human-recognition accuracy of machine-displayed behaviors. In addition to aspects of conveying these negotiation-related behaviors, we also focus on and report game-theoretical aspects of the overall interaction experience. In particular, we show that, as reported in the game-theory literature, certain negotiation strategies such as tit-for-tat may generate maximum combined utility for the negotiating parties, providing an excellent balance between the energy spent by the user and the combined utility of the negotiating parties.}

Specifically, a central platform lodges six silicone limbs, radially distributed, with cables embedded. A new mechanism-specific gait, invariant regarding the number of limbs, has been implemented. Functionally, some limbs provide stability while others push and pull the robot to locomote in the desired direction. Once the robot is close to a target, one limb is elected to wrap around the object and, thanks to the particular limb structure and the soft material, a friction-based grasping is achieved. The robot is inspired by the octopus and implements the key principles of locomotion in this animal, without coping the full body structure. For this reason it works in water, but it is not restricted to this environment. The experiments show the effectiveness of the original solution in locomotion and grasping.}

        abstract = {Control of soft robots remains nowadays a big challenge, as it does in the larger category of continuum robots. In this paper a direct and inverse kinetics models are described for a non-constant curvature structure. A major effort has been put recently in modelling and controlling constant curvature structures, such as cylindrical shaped manipulators. Manipulators with non-constant curvature, on the other hand, have been treated with a piecewise constant curvature approximation. In this work a non-constant curvature manipulator with a conical shape is built, taking inspiration from the anatomy of the octopus arm. The choice of a conical shape manipulator made of soft material is justified by its enhanced capability in grasping objects of different sizes. A different approach from the piecewise constant curvature approximation is employed for direct and inverse kinematics model. A continuum geometrically exact approach for direct kinetics model and a Jacobian method for inverse case are proposed. They are validated experimentally with a prototype soft robot arm moving in water. Results show a desired tip position in the task-space can be achieved automatically with a satisfactory degree of accuracy.}

Over the years, rover missions have demonstrated deployment of various scientific payloads for robotic field geology on these extra-terrestrial bodies. The success of these missions clearly emphasises the need to further advance rover technology in order to maximise scientific return. The success of future robotic surface exploration missions will depend on two key factors ? autonomy and mobility on soft sandy and unstructured terrains. The main contribution of this paper is that it brings together vital information pertaining to various terrain characterisation techniques into a single article. Special care is taken in structuring the paper so that all the relevant terrain characterisation methods that have been used in past planetary exploration missions and those under consideration for future space exploration missions are covered. This paper will not only lists advantages and disadvantages of various terrain characterisation techniques but also presents the methodology for evaluating and comparing terrain characterisation techniques and provides a trade-off study of existing and potential approaches that could improve the mobility of future planetary exploration rovers. This survey shows that further advances in currently deployed technology are required in order to develop intelligent, on-board sensing systems which will detect and identify near surface and sub-surface terrain properties to enhance the mobility of rovers.}

The biological implementation ofmemory shares little with memory in synthetic cognitive systems where it is typically regarded as a passive storage structure. Neurophysiological evidence indicates that memory is neither passive nor cen- tralised. A review of the relevant literature in the biological and computer sciences is conducted and a novel methodology is applied that incorporates neuroethological approaches with general biological inspiration in the design of synthetic cognitive systems: a case study regarding episodic memory provides an illustration of the utility of this methodology. As a consequence of applying this approach to the reinterpretation of the implementation of memory in syn- thetic systems, four fundamental functional principles are derived that are in accordance with neuroscientific theory, and which may be applied to the design of more adaptive and robust synthetic cognitive systems: priming, cross-modal associations, cross-modal coordination without semantic information transfer, and global system behavior resulting from activation dynamics within the mem- ory system.}

Based on this dynamic model, a new approach for implementing path planning of satellites using Artificial Potential Field (APF) method is presented in this paper. This paper discusses stability of the sliding surfaces designed using gradient of the potential function for the closed loop system. The stability analysis is demonstrated by presenting a scenario in which six satellites aggregates to form an octahedron formation and subsequently reconfigure to a hexagon formation. This paper thus presents further progress in the state of-the-art of path planning and control for the framework of satellite formation and reconfiguration missions.}

low-cost vision sensor and a standard desktop computer with a graphics processing
unit (GPU), together with software algorithms to enable detection, identification
and quantification of common defects affecting potatoes at near-real-time frame
rates. The system uses state-of-the-art image processing and machine learning
techniques to automatically learn the appearance of different defect types. It also
incorporates an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to enable easy set-up of the
system by quality control (QC) staff working in the industry.}

        abstract = {Even though in many systems, computers have been programmed to share control with human operators in order to increase task performance, the interaction in such systems is still artificial when compared to natural human-human cooperation. In complex tasks, cooperating human partners may have their own agendas and take initiatives during the task. Such initiatives contribute to a richer interaction between cooperating parties, yet little research exists on how this can be established between a human and a computer. In a cooperation involving haptics, the coupling between the human and the computer should be defined such that the computer can understand the intentions of the human operator and respond accordingly. We believe that this will make the haptic interactions between the human and the computer more natural and human-like. In this regard, we suggest (1) a role exchange mechanism that is activated based on the magnitude of the force applied by the cooperating parties and (2) a negotiation model that enables more human-like coupling between the cooperating parties. We argue that when presented through the haptic channel, the proposed role exchange mechanism and the negotiation model serve to communicate the cooperating parties dynamically, naturally, and seamlessly, in addition to improving the task efficiency of the user. In this chapter, we explore how human-computer cooperation can be improved using a role-exchange mechanism and a haptic negotiation framework. We also discuss the use of haptic negotiation in assigning different behaviors to the computer; and the effectiveness of visual and haptic cues in conveying negotiation-related complex affective states. Throughout this chapter, we will adopt a broad terminology and speak of cooperative systems, in which both parties take some part in control, as shared control schemes, but the term ?control? is merely used to address the partners? manipulation capacities on the task.}

A tight relationship between the muscular system and the nervous systems exists in the octopus. At a high level of abstraction, the same relationship between the mechanical structure and the control of the robot is presented here. The control board sends up to six signals to the limbs, which mechanically perform a stereotypical rhythmical movement. The results show how by coordinating only two limbs an effective locomotion is achieved.}

        abstract = {Since the strict separation of working spaces of humans and robots has experienced a softening due to recent robotics research achievements, close interaction of humans and robots comes rapidly into reach. In this context, physical human?robot interaction raises a number of questions regarding a desired intuitive robot behavior. The continuous bilateral information and energy exchange requires an appropriate continuous robot feedback. Investigating a cooperative manipulation task, the desired behavior is a combination of an urge to fulfill the task, a smooth instant reactive behavior to human force inputs and an assignment of the task effort to the cooperating agents. In this paper, a formal analysis of human?robot cooperative load transport is presented. Three different possibilities for the assignment of task effort are proposed. Two proposed dynamic role exchange mechanisms adjust the robot?s urge to complete the task based on the human feedback. For comparison, a static role allocation strategy not relying on the human agreement feedback is investigated as well. All three role allocation mechanisms are evaluated in a user study that involves large-scale kinesthetic interaction and full-body human motion. Results show tradeoffs between subjective and objective performance measures stating a clear objective advantage of the proposed dynamic role allocation scheme.}

        abstract = {Surface exploration of asteroids are scientifically important for understanding of the origin and history of our solar system. Space agencies all over the world have started to launch exploration missions to asteroids. Low cost, small-sized landers with some capability to move on the surface of an asteroid would be highly suitable for in-situ observations.

This paper primarily proposes on Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tool to handle the functional modelling of a class of small-scaled asteroid lander that would have requirements similar to the Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout (MASCOT) mission from the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). The latter aims at developing a landing package for the Hayabusa-2 mission. In this paper, System Modelling Language (SysML) is selected as the domain-specific language, and the lander system context is developed in the integrated development environmental (IDE) of IBM Rational Rhapsody.

The proposed unified functional modelling tool is platform independent. It covers a wide range of features for the lander system under consideration and proposes a clear decomposition of its functionalities. This MBSE approach can be easily adapted for other asteroid landers. Through this approach, systems engineers would make a rapid transformation from stakeholders' requirements to a functional model.

To this end, the proposed MBSE approach allows systems engineers and associated stakeholders at varying levels to define a number of common and basic lander scenarios derived from different levels of abstractions of the model system under test (i.e. the MASCOT lander). Furthermore, this proposed MBSE technique offers a structured and well-formed set of script templates for the lander model execution. Thus, allowing system engineers and stakeholders the privilege to verify, test and validate all functional, systems and interfacing requirements in a timely and efficient manner ? at varying stages in the project lifecycle. Further, the use of the animation feature of the Rational Rhapsody IDE to engineer the acquisition of visualised levels of detail for all SysML model elements and their respective executions will be presented.

Finally, to further show that the theoretical purity of the proposed MBSE approach does not mitigate against practical concerns, this approach is exemplified in a SysML model implementation of a shadow mission scenario ? the MASCOT lander}

        abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction problems can be solved by finding the minimizer of a suitable objective function. The objective function usually consists of a data fidelity term and a regularization term. Total variation (TV) minimization problems are widely used for solving incomplete data problems in CT image reconstruction. In this paper, we focus on the CT image reconstruction model which combines the TV regularization and ?1 data error term. We introduce a primal dual proximal point method of Chambolle-Pock algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem. We tested it on computer simulated data and the experiment results shown it exhibited good performance when used to few-view CT image reconstruction. {\copyright} 2012 IEEE.}

        abstract = {This paper reports the performance and effect of diverse keystroke features combination on keystroke dynamic authentication system by using fusion scheme. First of all, four types of keystroke features are acquired from our collected dataset, later then transformed into similarity scores by the use of Gaussian Probability Density Function (GPD) and Direction Similarity Measure (DSM). Next, three fusion schemes are introduced to merge the scores pairing with six fusion rules. Result shows that the finest performance is obtained by the combination of both dwell time and flight time collectively. Finally, this experiment also investigates the effect of using larger dataset on performance, which turns out to be rather consistent. {\^A}{\copyright} 2012 IEEE.}

        abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a top-down motion tracking model to detect the attention region. Many biological inspired systems have been studied and most of them are consisted by bottom-up mechanisms and top-down processes. Top-down attention is guided by task-driven information that is acquired through learning procedures. Our model improves the top-down mechanisms by using a probability map (PM). The PM follows to track if all the potential locations of targets based on the information contained in the frame sequences. By using this, PM can be regarded as a short term memory for attended saliency regions. This function is similar to the dorsal stream of V1 primary area. The semi-learning model constructs an efficient mechanism for attention detection to simulate the eye movements and fixations in our human visual systems. Generally, our work is to mimic human visual systems and it will further be applied on the robotics platform. From the random selected video clips, our performances are better than other state-of-the-art approaches. {\^A}{\copyright} 2012 IEEE.}
