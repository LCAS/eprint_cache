        abstract = {While deep learning techniques have become extremely popular for solving a broad range of optimization problems, methods to enforce hard constraints during optimization, particularly on deep neural networks, remain underdeveloped. Inspired by the rich literature on meshless interpolation and its extension to spectral collocation methods in scientific computing, we develop a series of approaches for enforcing hard constraints on neural fields. The constraints can be specified as a linear operator applied to the neural field at any differential order. We also design specific model representations and training strategies for problems where standard models may encounter difficulties. Our approaches are demonstrated in a wide range of real-world applications. Additionally, we develop a framework that enables highly efficient model and constraint specification, which can be readily applied to any downstream task where hard constraints need to be explicitly satisfied during optimization.}

Our study proposes a new fall detection method using computer vision based on modern deep learning techniques. Our approach involves training a transformer model on a large 2D pose dataset for general action recognition, followed by transfer learning. Specifically, we freeze the first few layers of the trained transformer model and train only the last two layers for fall detection. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches in fall/non-fall classification. Overall, our study suggests that our proposed methodology could be a valuable tool for identifying falls.}

In multi-robot system research, the main focus is on ensuring efficient coordination in the operation of the robots, both in task allocation and navigation. However, much of this research seldom strays from the theoretical bounds; there are many reasons for this, with the most prominent and -impactful being resource limitations. This is especially true for research in areas such as multi-robot path planning (MRPP) and navigation coordination. This is a large issue in practice as many approaches are not designed with meaningful real-world implications in mind and are not scalable to large multi-robot systems. This survey aimed to look into the coordination and path-planning issues and challenges faced when working with multi-robot systems, especially those using a prioritised planning approach and identify key areas that are not well-explored and the scope of applying existing MRPP approaches to real-world settings.}

The proposed compensator is based on a combination of spring-lever mechanisms that are adjustable to the robot?s configuration. Springs in this arrangement are mounted on sliding pivots that connected to springs that allow passive adjustment of the value of the counter-torque. While previous research is either concerned with gravity compensation or with variable stiffness actuators, the proposed approach deals with the variation of external loadings. The proposed force compensator can be used in robotics applications where the robot experiences high external loads during operation. The model was tested in simulation for a planar 2-DoF manipulator and a planar redundant 3-DoF manipulator. The presented results show 58.5\% torque reduction for 2-DoF and 55.2\% reduction for 3-DoF . Robot redundancy can enhance counter-balancing since the compensation level is configuration-dependent.}

        abstract = {Weeds pose a persistent threat to farmers' yields, but conventional methods for controlling weed populations, like herbicide spraying, pose a risk to surrounding ecosystems. Precision spraying aims to reduce harms to the surrounding environment by targeting only the weeds, rather than spraying the entire field with herbicide. Such an approach requires weeds to first be detected. With the advent of convolutional neural networks, there has been significant research trialling such technologies on datasets of weeds and crops. However, the evaluation of the performance of these approaches has often been limited to the standard machine learning metrics. This paper aims to assess the feasibility of precision spraying via a comprehensive evaluation of weed detection and spraying accuracy using two separate datasets, different image resolutions, and several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. A simplified model of precision spraying is proposed to compare the performance of different detection algorithms while varying the precision of spray nozzles. The key performance indicators in precision spraying that this study focuses on are a high weed hit rate and a reduction in herbicide usage. This paper introduces two metrics, namely Weed Coverage Rate and area sprayed, to capture these aspects of the real-world performance of precision spraying and demonstrates their utility through experimental results. Using these metrics to calculate spraying performance, it was found that 93\% of weeds could be sprayed, by spraying just 30\% of the area using state of the art vision methods to identify weeds.}

        abstract = {In general, optimal motion planning can be performed both locally and globally. In such a planning, the choice in favour of either local or global planning technique mainly depends on whether the environmental conditions are dynamic or static. Hence, the most adequate choice is to use local planning or local planning alongside global planning. When designing optimal motion planning both local and global, the key metrics to bear in mind are execution time,  asymptotic optimality, and quick reaction to dynamic obstacles. Such planning approaches can address the aforesaid target metrics more efficiently compared to other approaches such as path planning followed by smoothing. Thus, the foremost objective of this study is to analyse related literature in order to understand how the motion planning, especially trajectory planning, problem is formulated, when being applied for generating optimal trajectories in real-time for Multirotor Aerial Vehicles, impacts the listed metrics. As a result of the research,  the trajectory planning problem was broken down into a set of subproblems, and the lists of methods for addressing each of the problems were identified and described in detail. Subsequently,  the most prominent results from 2010 to 2022 were summarized and presented in the form of a timeline.}

        abstract = {Industrial robot-based Incremental Sheet metal Forming (ISF) is known as Roboforming. Industrial robots are being adopted for forming operations because they allow higher tool flexibility in terms of positioning and orientating the tool and a larger workspace at a minimum cost compared to CNC-based ISF. However, the lower stiffness of the robots leads to undesirable geometrical anomalies and deviations in the formed part. Along with the externally applied forces, robot configuration changes also impact the tool?s positional accuracy. An attempt has been made to study the influence of robot configurations on overall part deviations in Roboforming due to robot compliance. Understanding changes in compliance or stiffness changes owing to different robot poses is a necessary step for optimizing the transition from a traditional CNC-based ISF to a robot-assisted ISF. Robot stiffness-based deviations are evaluated using an analytical approach, and configuration-based deflections are studied using FEM-based approaches for their contribution to the overall part deviations. Results are compared to the sheet metal forming experiments conducted over conventional 3-axis CNC for forming a cone-shaped profile using a spiral toolpath. It is highlighted that the overall deviations in the formed components are influenced by robot compliance and pose.}

The proposed technique is based on the deep residual neural network and dedicated finite state machine, where the states are the robot behavior modes and transitions are the switchings between the states that depend on the interaction parameters and characteristics. It ensures the human operator safety and improves the human?robot collaboration performance by implementing various scenarios. In the scope of this technique, the parameters of human?robot interaction are used to select an appropriate robot reaction strategy using data from internal robot sensors only, i.e. proprioceptive sensors. These parameters define the interaction force vector and its application point on the robot surface, which allow to classify the interaction within the set of predefined categories. This classification distinguishes interactions applied at the tool or intermediate link (Tool/Link), having soft or hard nature (Soft/Hard), as well as having different intention (Intl/Accd) or duration (Short/Long). Based on identified category and the current robot state, the algorithm chooses an appropriate robot reaction. To confirm the efficiency the developed technique, an experimental study was conducted, which involved the collaboration between the real industrial manipulator KUKA LBR iiwa and the human operator.}

        abstract = {The growing number of space debris is alarming as it threatens space-borne services. Hence, there is an increasing demand to remove space debris to ensure sustainability and protect valuable orbital assets. Over the past few years, the research community, agencies and industries have studied many passive and active debris removal methods. However, the current technology readiness for space debris removal is still low. This paper first presents a comparative study of various space debris removal technologies to address the knowledge gap and quantify the challenges. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art space technologies relevant to Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions. Detailed trade-off analysis is then presented based on the Low Earth Orbit Pursuit for Active Removal of Debris (LEOPARD) Phase 0-A study; this study is part of the United Kingdom (UK) Space Agency?s Active Debris Removal programme. The ADR mission scenario considered in this paper comprises a chaser spacecraft equipped with recommended technologies to capture non-cooperative targets safely. The final capture technology for the LEOPARD mission consists of an active robotic manipulator and a passive net capture mechanism. An analysis of the coupled-body dynamics of the chaser spacecraft carrying the robot manipulator and the targeted debris is carried out in simulation using SimscapeTM. The chaser spacecraft comprises Airbus?s Versatile In-Space and Planetary Arm (VISPA) mounted on a base spacecraft from Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL); the targeted debris is SSTL?s Tactical Operational Satellite (TOPSAT). The simulation results show dynamic changes in the chaser robot and the target satellite while performing non-cooperative capture. The simulation study accounted for various operational scenarios where the target is stationary or in motion. Further, for different modes of operation, the worst-case end-effector capture force limits were determined using open-loop control to execute a safe capture. Overall, the results presented in the paper advance the current state-of-the-art of robotic ADR and offer a significant leap in designing close-range motion and force control for stabilising the coupled multi-body system during capture and post-capture phases. In summary, this paper pinpoints the technological gaps, identifies barriers to realising ADR missions and offers solutions to catalyse technology maturity for protecting the space ecosystem.}

This study introduces a new approach for mobile robots to navigate uneven terrains. The method uses a compact graph of traversable regions on point cloud maps, created through the utilization of supervoxel representation of point clouds. By using this supervoxel graph, the method navigates the robot to any reachable goal pose by utilizing a navigation function and Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC). The NMPC ensures kinodynamically feasible and collision-free motion plans, while the supervoxel-based geometric planning generates near-optimal plans by exploiting the terrain information. We conducted extensive navigation experiments in real and simulated 3D uneven terrains and found that the approach performs reliably. Additionally, we compared resulting motion plans to some state-of-the-art sampling-based motion planners in which our method outperformed them in terms of execution time and resulting path lengths. The method can also be adapted to meet specific behavior, like the shortest route or the path with the least slope route. The source code is available in a GitHub repository.}

        abstract = {In field robotics, particularly in the agricultural sector, precise localization presents a challenge due to the constantly changing nature of the environment. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms can provide an effective estimation of a robot?s position, but their long-term performance may be impacted by false data associations. Additionally, alternative strategies such as the use of RTK-GPS can also have limitations, such as dependence on external infrastructure. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel stability scan filter. This filter can learn and infer the motion status of objects in the environment, allowing it to identify the most stable objects and use them as landmarks for robust robot localization in a continuously changing environment. The proposed method involves an unsupervised point-wise labelling of LiDAR frames by utilizing temporal observations of the environment, as well as a regression network called Long-Term Stability Network (LTSNET) to learn and infer 3D LiDAR points long-term motion status. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the stability scan filter to infer the motion stability of objects on a real agricultural long-term dataset. Results show that by only utilizing points belonging to long-term stable objects, the localization system exhibits reliable and robust localization performance for longterm missions compared to using the entire LiDAR frame points.}

        abstract = {Selective robotic harvesting can help address labour shortages affecting modern global agriculture. For an accurate and efficient picking process, a robotic harvester requires the precise location and orientation of the fruit to effectively plan the trajectory of the end effector. The current methods for estimating fruit orientation employ either complete 3D information registered from multiple views or rely on fully-supervised learning techniques, requiring difficult-to-obtain manual annotation of the reference orientation. In this paper, we introduce a novel key-point-based fruit orientation estimation method for the prediction of 3D orientation from 2D images directly. The proposed technique can work without full 3D orientation annotations but can also exploit such information for improved accuracy. We evaluate our work on two separate datasets of strawberry images obtained from real-world scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average error as low as 8?, improving predictions by {$\sim$}30\% compared to previous work presented in [18]. Furthermore, our method is suited for real-time robotic applications with fast inference times of {$\sim$}30ms.}

        abstract = {Since the launch of Sputnik in 1957, chrome and nickel steel alloys have been widely used for building satellites and launchers for manned and unmanned missions. Their high resistance to extreme temperatures makes them ideal for spacecraft heatshields. The James Webb Space telescope used steel molds to construct its 6.5m primary mirror containing pressed beryllium powder. Steel tubes are also used for building a telescope?s cooling system. Likewise, solar sails use steel booms to ensure proper deployment. Various other sub-systems on board the International Space Station and other spacecraft are made of steel and other high-value materials.  These examples give an insight into the application of steel and its unprecedented needs in the booming Space industry.
Although humankind continues to benefit tremendously from advancements in Space Science and Technology, there is a growing concern over space sustainability. Millions of Space debris, large and small, orbiting Earth threaten the space ecosystem. To address this alarming issue, many investors, regulators and insurers have stepped in to support Active Debris Removal missions to clean up Space. However, the current approach is to deorbit space debris, but the remnants returned to Earth are non-biodegradable objects, polluting the oceans and affecting marine lives. Space trash is an immense resource that should be reused for manufacturing newer systems in orbit. The feedstock needed for on-demand manufacturing of new or replacement parts and components can be produced by recycling materials in orbit, including those previously used for packaging or current space debris. This includes the abundance of steel and other metals on the orbiting space debris. However, research on recycling space debris and additive manufacturing in Space is still in its infancy, hindering the goal of achieving an in-space circular economy. 
Considering the importance of net-zero manufacturing on the ground and in Space, recycling materials from space debris for on-demand manufacturing in orbit would be environmentally friendly and economically profitable. This paper presents the technological challenges in recovering and reusing steel and other high-value materials floating around the Earth?s orbits. Further, the benefits of in-orbit recycling operations for implementing on-demand design and fabrication services will be introduced. The state-of-the-art additive manufacturing in Space, the technological gaps, and the step towards manufacturing green steel from space debris will be covered. Such capabilities will significantly reduce launch costs and carbon footprint by decreasing the number of launches and the need for ground-based fabrication. The paradigm shift toward in-space manufacturing aligns well with our curiosity to continue to explore the universe and improve lives on Earth whilst achieving a sustainable circular economy on Earth and in Space.}

The computational complexity of simulating large multi-robot systems in these simulators can be prohibitively high. To achieve faster-than-realtime simulation of a multi-robot system for rapid experimentation, we present `move\_base\_abstract', a ROS package providing a high-level abstraction of robot navigation as a ``drop-in'' replacement for the standard `move\_base' navigation, and a bespoke integrated minimal simulator. This bespoke simulator is compatible with ROS and strips the simulation of robots down to the representation of robot poses in 2D space, control of robots via navigation goals, and control of simulation time over ROS topic messages.
Replication of an existing MRS simulated study using `move\_base\_abstract' executed 2.87 times faster than the real-time that was simulated in the study, and analysis of the results of this replication shows room for further optimisations.}

We consider how to optimise control of the base and the end actuator together, to minimise total time taken to visit the plants.  Our approach is based on low level combination of simple motion primitives, with mid level target clustering, and higher level planning. For the high level, three strategies are compared and evaluated in simulation: baseline stop-and-spray, constant velocity, and variable velocity. The baseline strategy is common in existing systems, and is shown to be outperformed by the new methods. The application considered here is weed spraying, but the methods are applicable to many tasks.}

The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding-attacks are prominent attacks on IoT. DDoS concerns security professionals due to its nature in forming sophisticated attacks that can be bandwidth-busting. DDoS can cause unplanned IoT-services outages, hence requiring prompt and efficient DDoS mitigation. In this paper, we propose a DDoS-FOCUS; a solution to mitigate DDoS attacks on fog nodes. The solution encompasses a machine learning model implanted at fog nodes to detect DDoS attackers. A hybrid deep learning model was developed using Conventional Neural Network and Bidirectional LSTM (CNN-BiLSTM) to mitigate future DDoS attacks. A preliminary test of the proposed model produced an accuracy of 99.8\% in detecting DDoS attacks.}

        abstract = {Nowadays, most agricultural robots rely on precise and expensive localisation, typically based on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and real-time kinematic (RTK) receivers. Unfortunately, the precision of GNSS localisation significantly decreases in environments where the signal paths between the receiver and the satellites are obstructed. This precision hampers deployments of these robots in, e.g., polytunnels or forests. An attractive alternative to GNSS is vision-based localisation and navigation. However, perceptual aliasing and landmark deficiency, typical for agricultural environments, cause traditional image processing techniques, such as feature matching, to fail. We propose an approach for an affordable pure vision-based navigation system which is not only robust to perceptual aliasing, but it actually exploits the repetitiveness of agricultural environments. Our system extends the classic concept of visual teach and repeat to visual teach and generalise (VTAG). Our teach and generalise method uses a deep learning-based image registration pipeline to register similar images through meaningful generalised representations obtained from different but similar areas. The proposed system uses only a low-cost uncalibrated monocular camera and the robot?s wheel odometry to produce heading corrections to traverse crop rows in polytunnels safely. We evaluate this method at our test farm and at a commercial farm on three different robotic platforms where an operator teaches only a single crop row. With all platforms, the method successfully navigates the majority of rows with most interventions required at the end of the rows, where the camera no longer has a view of any repeating landmarks such as poles, crop row tables or rows which have visually different features to that of the taught row. For one robot which was taught one row 25 m long our approach autonomously navigated the robot a total distance of over 3.5 km, reaching a teach-generalisation gain of 140.}

However, accurately aligning heterogeneous UAV images poses challenges due to differences in geometry, intensity, and noise resulting from varying imaging principles. This paper presents a two-stage registration method aimed at fusing visible RGB and multispectral images for cotton leaf lesion grading. The coarse alignment stage utilizes Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), while the refined alignment stage employs a novel correlation coefficient-based template matching. The proposed method first employs the EfficientDet network to detect infected cotton leaves with lesions in RGB images. Subsequently, lesion leaves in multiple spectral imagery (red, green, red edge, and near-infrared bands) are located using the perspective transformation matrix derived from SIFT and the coordinates of lesion leaves in RGB images. Refined registration between RGB and multispectral imagery is achieved through template matching with the new correlation coefficient. The registered reflectance data from the different spectral bands and RGB components are utilized to classify pixels in each infected leaf into lesion, healthy, and soil parts. The lesion grade is determined based on the ratio of lesion pixels to the total corresponding leaf area. Experimental results, compared with manual assessment, demonstrate a lesion leaves detection model with a mAP@0.5 of 91.01\% and a leaf lesion grading accuracy of 92.01\%. These results validate the suitability of the proposed method for UAV RGB and multispectral image registration, enabling automated cotton leaf lesion grading.}

In this paper, we present a new approach for context reasoning to further advance the field of human motion prediction. We therefore propose a neuro-symbolic approach for human motion prediction (NeuroSyM), which weights differently the interactions in the neighbourhood by leveraging an intuitive technique for spatial representation called Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC).
 The proposed approach is experimentally tested on medium and long term time horizons using two architectures from the state of art, one of which is  a baseline for human motion prediction and the other is a baseline for generic multivariate time-series prediction. Six datasets of challenging crowded scenarios, collected from both fixed and mobile cameras, were used for testing. Experimental results show that the NeuroSyM approach outperforms in most cases the baseline architectures in terms of prediction accuracy.}

        abstract = {In this paper we propose a new model to represent human debates and methods to obtain collective conclusions from them. This model overcomes two drawbacks of existing approaches. First, our model does not assume that participants agree on the structure of the debate. It does this by allowing participants to express their opinion about all aspects of the debate.  Second, our model does not assume that participants' opinions are rational, an assumption that significantly limits current approaches. Instead, we define a weaker notion of rationality that characterises coherent opinions, and we consider different scenarios based on the coherence of individual opinions and the level of consensus.  
We provide a formal analysis of different opinion aggregation functions that compute a collective decision based on the individual opinions and the debate structure. In particular, we demonstrate that aggregated opinions can be coherent even if there is a lack of consensus and individual opinions are not coherent. We conclude with an empirical evaluation demonstrating that collective opinions can be computed efficiently for real-sized debates.}

The topology of agricultural farms such as polytunnels provides a basic environmental configuration that can be exploited to create a topological map to aid operational planning and robot navigation. However, these environments are optimised for operations by humans or for large farming vehicles and pose a major challenge for multiple moving robots to coordinate their navigation while performing tasks.  The farm environment without any topological modifications for supporting robotic fleet deployments can cause traffic bottlenecks, eventually affecting the overall efficiency of the fleet. In this work, we propose a Genetic Algorithm-based Topological Optimisation (GATO) algorithm that discretises the search space of topological modifications into finite integer combinations. Each solution is encoded as an integer vector that contains the location information of the topology modification. The algorithm is evaluated in a discrete event simulation of the picking and in-field logistics process in a commercial strawberry farm and the results validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in identifying the topological modifications that improve the efficiency of the robotic fleet operations.

        abstract = {Abstract{--}Real-time vision in robotics plays an important role in localising and recognising objects. Recently, deep learning approaches have been widely used in robotic vision. However, most of these approaches have assumed that training and test sets come from similar data distributions, which is not valid in many real world applications. This study proposes an approach to address domain generalisation (i.e. out-of distribution generalisation, OODG) where the goal is to train a model via one or more source domains, that will generalise well to unknown target domains using single stage detectors. All existing approaches which deal with OODG either use slow two stage detectors or operate under the covariate shift assumption which may not be useful for real-time robotics. This is the first paper to address domain generalisation in the context of single stage anchor free object detector FCOS without the covariate shift assumption. We focus on improving the generalisation ability of object detection by proposing new regularisation terms to address the domain shift that arises due to both classification and bounding box regression. Also, we include an additional consistency regularisation term to align the local and global level predictions. The proposed approach is implemented as a Domain Generalised Fully Convolutional One Stage (DGFCOS) detection and evaluated using four object detection datasets which provide domain metadata (GWHD, Cityscapes, BDD100K, Sim10K) where it exhibits a consistent performance improvement over the baselines and is able to run in real-time for robotics.}

        abstract = {Multi-robot systems (MRS) are currently being introduced in many in-field logistics operations in large environments such as warehouses and commercial soft-fruit production. Collision avoidance is a critical problem in MRS as it may introduce deadlocks during the motion planning. In this work, a discretised topological map representation is used for low-cost route planning of individual robots as well as to easily switch the navigation actions depending on the constraints in the environment. However, this topological map could also have bottlenecks which leads to deadlocks and low transportation efficiency when used for an MRS. In this paper, we propose a resource container based Request-Release-Interrupt (RRI) algorithm that constrains each topological node with a capacity of one entity and therefore helps to avoid collisions and detect deadlocks. Furthermore, we integrate a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Discrete Event Simulation (DES) for optimising the topological map to reduce deadlocks and improve transportation efficiency in logistics tasks. Performance analysis of the proposed algorithms are conducted after running a set of simulations with multiple robots and different maps. The results validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.}

        abstract = {This project proposes a framework for online adaptation of robot behaviours deployed autonomously in social settings with the goal of increasing the overall users' engagement during the interactions.
One of the most critical aspects to address for robots deployed in ``the real world'' is the necessity of interacting with people, whether intentionally or not. Interacting with people requires a wide range of capabilities, from perceiving the different people's intentions and emotional states to generating appropriate behaviours for the specific context of the interaction. Moreover, it requires that robots learn and adapt from experience while interacting with their users. In this project, a mobile robot is embedded in a long-term study in a public museum. The robot has been deployed for more than a year, to date, as an autonomous tour guide to the museum's visitors, with its tasks being guiding people to the position of various exhibits and giving a description of each item.  The long-term scenario allows studying how people interact with a robot in an unconstrained setting and give the opportunity of improving the current state-of-the-art robotics autonomy in a social setting.
The initial data collection shows that users' engagement during the robotised tours steeply declines after the initial moments of the interaction. The first main contribution of this project is to investigate whether it is possible to automatically assess the users' engagement from the robot point-of-view during the interactions. A dataset of robot ego-centric videos was collected and manually annotated by independent coders with continuous engagement values. From it, an end-to-end regression model was trained to predict engagement from the robot point of view from a single camera. Experimental evaluation shows that the model accurately estimates the engagement level of people during an interaction, even in diverse environments and with different robots. 
Once the robot can detect the engagement state of users during the interactions, it can potentially plan tangential behaviours to influence the users' attentional state itself. The second contribution of this work is devising an online reinforcement learning algorithm that allows the robot to adapt its behaviour online from the feedback obtained during the interactions. The feedback is obtained from users' engagement values estimated from the robot head camera. In the experimental evaluation, the robot delivers the usual tours to the users with the difference that the choice of some actions is left to the adaptive learning algorithm. Results show that after a few months of exploration, the robot successfully learns a policy that leads people to stay in the interaction for longer.}

It is commonly accepted that there is no universal approach that can address the needs of all robot platforms and applications. A number of established architectures have been developed based on the publish-subscribe and action-client paradigms employed by Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware. Extending on these developments, in this research, we present a novel robotic software architecture that enables seamless integration of different robotics software components, such as Planning, Control, and Perception. The presented architecture is designed to ensure the autonomous navigation of a mobile robot operating in uneven outdoor terrains, while also supporting indoor environments with appropriate customization.

However, associating repeated 3D scans of plants across time is challenging. A key step in this process is re-identifying and tracking the same individual plant components over time. Previously, this has been achieved by comparing their global spatial or topological location. In this work, we demonstrate how using shape features improves temporal organ matching. We present a landmark-free shape compression algorithm, which allows for the extraction of 3D shape features of leaves, characterises leaf shape and curvature efficiently in few parameters, and makes the association of individual leaves in feature space possible. The approach combines 3D contour extraction and further compression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to produce a shape space encoding, which is entirely learned from data and retains information about edge contours and 3D curvature. Our evaluation on temporal scan sequences of tomato plants shows, that incorporating shape features improves temporal leaf-matching. A combination of shape, location, and rotation information proves most informative for recognition of leaves over time and yields a true positive rate of 75\%, a 15\% improvement on sate-of-the-art methods. This is essential for robotic crop monitoring, which enables whole-of-lifecycle phenotyping.}

Biological and biomechanical studies have shown that the vibration generated by elastically suspended masses provides an energy advantage over rigidly carrying the same load. The robotic validation of these findings has only scarcely been explored in the dynamic walking case. In this context, a relationship has emerged between the design parameters and the actuation that generates the optimal gait. Although very relevant, these studies lack a generalizable analysis of different locomotion modes and a possible strategy to obtain optimal locomotion at different speeds. To this end, we propose the use of articulated legs in an extended Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model with an elastically suspended mass. Thanks to this model, we show how stiffness and damping can be modulated through articulated legs by selecting the knee angle at touch-down. Therefore, by choosing different body postures, it is possible to vary the control parameters and reach different energetically optimal speeds. At the same time, this modeling allows the study of the stability of the defined system. The results show how suitable control choices reduce energy expenditure by 16\% at the limit cycle at a chosen speed. The demonstrated strategy could be used in the design and control of legged robots where energy consumption would be dynamically optimal and usage time would be significantly increased.}

Soft probes in different sizes were designed and fabricated using a Form3 3D printer and Elastic50A resin, for which the effect of gravity is not negligible. Experimental results verified the performance of the proposed method that achieved a position error between of -0.7-13mm, while different external forces (between 0.01N to 1.5N) were applied along the soft probes to resemble the condition of touching lightweight objects.

Digitalisation enables firms to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs), address climate change and the wider negative externalities of food production such as biodiversity loss, and diffuse pollution. Digitalising at the business and supply chain level through public-private mechanisms for data exchange affords the opportunity for greater collaboration, visualising and measuring activities and their socio-environmental impact, demonstrating compliance with regulatory and market requirements and providing opportunity to capture current practice and future opportunities for process and product improvement. Herein we consider digitalisation as a tool to drive innovation and transition to a decarbonised food system. We consider that deep decarbonisation of the food system can only occur when trusted emissions data are exchanged across supply chains. This requires fusion of standardised emissions measurements within a supply chain data sharing framework. This framework, likely operating as a corporate entity, would provide the foci for measurement standards, data exchange, trusted and certified data and as a multi-stakeholder body, including regulators, that would build trust and collaboration across supply chains. This approach provides a methodology for accurate and trusted emissions data to inform consumer choice and industrial response of individual firms within a supply chain.}

We used a three-part process of varied design methods, which included collaborative ideation and speculative scenario development, the creation of design fiction objects, and assessment using the Moral-IT deck, a card-based tool. We present, through the lens of the EPSRC's Framework for Responsible Innovation how processes of anticipation, reflection, engagement and action built a plausible, fictional world in which a data trust uses artificial intelligence (AI) to support data sharing and decision-making across the food supply chain. This approach provides rich opportunities for considering ethical challenges to data sharing as part of a reflexive and engaged responsible innovation approach. We reflect on the value and potential of this approach as a method for engaged (co-)design and responsible innovation.}

        abstract = {Nowadays, there is a growing awareness on the social and economic importance of the ocean. In this context, being able to carry out a diverse range of operations underwater is of paramount importance for many industrial sectors as well as for marine science and to enforce restoration and mitigation actions. Underwater robots allowed us to venture deeper and for longer time into the remote and hostile marine environment. However, traditional design concepts such as propeller driven remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, or tracked benthic crawlers, present intrinsic limitations, especially when a close interaction with the environment is required. An increasing number of researchers are proposing legged robots as a bioinspired alternative to traditional designs, capable of yielding versatile multi-terrain locomotion, high stability, and low environmental disturbance. In this work, we aim at presenting the new field of underwater legged robotics in an organic way, discussing the prototypes in the state-of-the-art and highlighting technological and scientific challenges for the future. First, we will briefly recap the latest developments in traditional underwater robotics from which several technological solutions can be adapted, and on which the benchmarking of this new field should be set. Second, we will the retrace the evolution of terrestrial legged robotics, pinpointing the main achievements of the field. Third, we will report a complete state of the art on underwater legged robots focusing on the innovations with respect to the interaction with the environment, sensing and actuation, modelling and control, and autonomy and navigation. Finally, we will thoroughly discuss the reviewed literature by comparing traditional and legged underwater robots, highlighting interesting research opportunities, and presenting use case scenarios derived from marine science applications.}

In this paper, we propose an extension of a state-of-the-art causal discovery method, PCMCI, embedding an additional feature-selection module based on transfer entropy. Starting from a prefixed set of variables, the new algorithm reconstructs the causal model of the observed system by considering only the its main features and neglecting those deemed unnecessary for understanding the evolution of the system. We first validate the method on a toy problem, for which the ground-truth model is available, and then on a real-world robotics scenario using a large-scale time-series dataset of human trajectories. The experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms the previous state-of-the-art technique in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing better and faster causal discovery of meaningful models from robot sensor data.}

Despite these difficulties, teleoperated robotic systems are still popular in several industrial applications, e.g., remote handling of hazardous material. In this context, we present a novel haptic shared control method for minimising the manipulator torque effort during remote manipulative actions in which an operator is assisted in selecting a suitable grasping pose for then displacing an object along a desired trajectory. Minimising torque is important because it reduces the system operating cost and extends the range of objects that can be manipulated. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a series of representative real-world pick-and-place experiments as well as in human subjects studies. The reported results prove the effectiveness of our shared control vs. a standard teleoperation approach. We also find that haptic-only guidance performs better than visually guidance, although combining them together leads to the best overall results.}

Mainstream underwater grippers are designed for the heavy load tasks typical of the industrial sector; however, due to the lack of alternatives, they are frequently used in biological sampling applications to handle irregular, delicate, and deformable specimens with a consequent high risk of damage. To overcome this limitation, the design of grippers for marine science applications should explicitly account for the requirements of end-users. In this paper, we aim at making a step forward and propose to systematically account for the needs of end-users by resorting to design tools used in industry for the conceptualization of new products which can yield great benefits to both applied robotic research and marine science. After the generation of the concept design for the gripper using a reduced version of the House of Quality and the Pugh decision matrix, we reported on its mechanical design, construction, and preliminary testing. The paper reports on the full design pipeline from requirements collection to preliminary testing with the aim of fostering and providing structure to fruitful interdisciplinary collaborations at the interface of robotics and marine science.}

While the topic is attracting increasing interest, it has not been studied in detail in the context of object detection. The established approaches all operate under the covariate shift assumption, where the conditional distributions are assumed to be approximately equal across source domains. This is the first paper to address domain generalisation in the context of object detection, with a rigorous mathematical analysis of domain shift, without the covariate shift assumption. We focus on improving the generalisation ability of object detection by proposing new regularisation terms to address the domain shift that arises due to both classification and bounding box regression. Also, we include an additional consistency regularisation term to align the local and global level predictions. The proposed approach is implemented as a Domain Generalised Faster R-CNN and evaluated using four object detection datasets which provide domain metadata (GWHD, Cityscapes, BDD100K, Sim10K) where it exhibits a consistent performance improvement over the baselines.

While the process is straightforward in the sense that a hermeneutic analysis is conducted so as to detect patterns and assign themes emerging from the data acquired, replicability can be challenging. As a result, there is significant debate about what constitutes reliability and rigour in relation to qualitative coding. Traditional thematic analysis in educational sciences requires the development of a codebook and the recruitment of a research team for intercoder reviewing and code testing. Such a process is often lengthy and infeasible when the number of texts to be analysed increases exponentially. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we use an unsupervised text analysis technique called the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify distinct abstract topics which are then clustered into potential themes. Our results show that thematic analysis in the field of educational sciences using the LDA text analysis technique has prospects of demonstrating rigour and higher thematic coding reliability and validity while offering a valid intra-coder complementary support to the researcher.}

These considerations and their implications influence technology design, the ways in which technology is applied, how the technology changes food supply chain practices, decision-making and the associated ethical aspects and outcomes.
Scope and approach: Using the concept of reflexive governance, this paper has critiqued existing reflective food-related ethical assessment tools and proposed the structural elements required for reflexive governance architectures which address both the sharing of data, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in food supply chains. 
Key findings and conclusions: Considering the ethical implications of using autonomous technology in real life contexts is challenging. The current approach, focusing on discrete ethical elements in isolation e.g., ethical aspects or outcomes, normative standards or ethically orientated compliance-based business strategies is not sufficient in itself. Alternatively, the application of more holistic, reflexive governance architectures can inform consideration of ethical aspects, potential ethical outcomes, in particular how they are interlinked and/or interdependent, and the need for mitigation at all lifecycle stages of technology and food product conceptualisation, design, realisation and adoption in the food supply chain. This research is of interest to those who are undertaking ethical deliberation on data sharing, and  the use of AI and machine learning in food supply chains.}

Solutions for the control problem of N-Trailers have been formulated mostly for vehicles with solely on-axle hitching or off-axle hitching but in field applications such as agriculture, most of the structures used are Generalized N-Trailers (GNT) which have a combination of on- and off-axle hitching. Moreover, most of the solutions in literature were developed and tested for laboratory-scale platforms under ideal indoor conditions. However, in outdoors conditions, the motion performance is commonly degraded by model uncertainties, slipping of wheels, and trailers localization loss product of noisy or inaccurate sensor data. In this context, this paper reports the use of Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) with a Dual-Stage Disturbance Observer (DS-DO) to improve the backward trajectory-tracking performance of GNT in no ideal conditions, where the DS-DO aims to attenuate the effects of error propagation on the ADRC compensation loop and improve the overall closed-loop performance. The proposed ADRC+DS-DO has been validated in simulation and real experiments showing overall improvements on the controller effort reduction and reduction of up to 57\% on the tracking error against a traditional ADRC approach already existent in the literature.}

The work of this paper has been developed with the aim of implementing a safety system, based on computer vision algorithms, able to detect people in working environments using an embedded device. Possible applications for such safety systems include remote site monitoring and autonomous mobile robots in warehouses and industrial premises. Similar studies already exist in the literature, but they mostly rely on systems like NVidia Jetson that, with a Cuda enabled GPU, are able to provide satisfactory results. This, however, comes with a significant downside as such devices are usually expensive and require significant power consumption. The current paper instead is going to consider various implementations of computer vision-based person detection on two power-efficient and inexpensive devices, namely Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. In order to do so, some solutions based on off-the-shelf algorithms are first explored by reporting experimental results based on relevant performance metrics. Then, the paper presents a newly-created custom architecture, called eYOLO, that tries to solve some limitations of the previous systems. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the good performance of the proposed approach and suggests ways for further improvement.}

The probabilistic nature of SBO planners can also complicate this procedure, as different results for the same planning problem can be obtained even in consecutive queries from the same planner. We compare all available SBO planners in OMPL with an automated planning problem generation method designed specifically for outdoor robot navigation scenarios. Several evaluation metrics are chosen, such as the length, smoothness, and success rate of the resulting path, and probability distributions for metrics are presented. With the experimental results obtained, clear recommendations on high-performing planners for mobile robot path planning problems are made, which will be useful to researchers and practitioners in mobile robot planning and navigation.}

To be suitable for robots, causal analysis must be both fast and accurate, meeting real-time demands and the limited computational resources typical in most robotics applications. In this paper, we present a practical demonstration of our approach for fast and accurate causal analysis, known as Filtered PCMCI (F-PCMCI), along with a real-world robotics application. The provided application illustrates how our F-PCMCI can accurately and promptly reconstruct the causal model of a human-robot interaction scenario, which can then be leveraged to enhance the quality of the interaction.}

A prerequisite for site-specific weed management is the availability of accurate maps of the weed population that can be generated quickly and cheaply. Improvements and cost reductions in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and camera technology mean these tools are now readily available for agricultural use. We used UAVs to collect aerial images captured in both RGB and multispectral formats of 12 cereal fields (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] and barley [Hordeum vulgare L.]) across eastern England. These data were used to train machine learning models to generate prediction maps of locations of black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.), a prolific weed in UK cereal fields. We tested machine learning and data set resampling methods to obtain the most accurate system for predicting the presence and absence of weeds in new out-of-sample fields. The accuracy of the system in predicting the absence of A. myosuroides is 69\% and its presence above 5 g in weight with 77\% accuracy in new out-of-sample fields. This system generates prediction maps that can be used by either agricultural machinery or autonomous robotic platforms for precision weed management. Improvements to the accuracy can be made by increasing the number of fields and samples in the data set and the length of time over which data are collected to gather data across the entire growing season.}

State-of-the-art solutions for autonomous navigation in such environments require expensive hardware such as RTK-GNSS.

Existing datasets for crop row detection does not represent all the possible field variations. A dataset of sugar beet images was created representing 11 field variations comprised of multiple grow stages, light levels, varying weed
densities, curved crop rows and discontinuous crop rows.
The proposed pipeline segments the crop rows using a deep
learning-based method and employs the predicted segmentation mask for extraction of the central crop using a novel
central crop row selection algorithm. The novel crop row
detection algorithm was tested for crop row detection performance and the capability of visual servoing along a crop
row. The visual servoing-based navigation was tested on a

        abstract = {In the last decades, robotic solutions have been introduced in agriculture to improve the efficiency of tasks such as spraying, plowing, and seeding. However, for a more complex task like soft-fruit harvesting, the efficiency of experienced human pickers has not been surpassed yet by robotic solutions. Thus, in the immediate future, human labor will probably be still necessary for picking tasks while robotic platforms could be used as collaborators, supporting the pickers in the transportation of the harvested fruit. This cooperative harvesting strategy creates a human?robot interaction (HRI) that requires significant further development in human-aware safe navigation and effective bidirectional communication of intent. In fact, although agricultural robots are considered small/medium size machinery, they still represent a risk of causing injuries to human collaborators, especially if people are not trained to work with robots or robot operations are not intuitive. Avoiding such injury is the aim of this work which contributes to the development, implementation, and evaluation of a human-aware navigation (HAN) module that can be integrated into the autonomous navigation system of commercial agricultural robots. The proposed module is responsible for the detection and monitoring of humans working around the robot and uses this information to activate safety actions depending on whether the human presence is considered at risk or not. Apart from ensuring a physically safe HRI, the proposed module deals with the comfort level and psychological safety of human coworkers. The latter is possible by using an explicit human?robot communication strategy that lets both know of the other's intentions, increasing the level of trust and reducing inefficient pauses triggered by unnecessary safety actions. The proposed HAN solution was integrated into a commercial agricultural robot and tested in several situations that are expected to happen during cooperative harvesting operations. The results of a usability assessment illustrated the benefits of the proposal in terms of safety, efficiency, and ergonomics.}

        abstract = {Goal recognisers attempt to infer an agent?s intentions from a sequence of observed actions. This is an important component of intelligent systems that aim to assist or thwart actors; however, there are many challenges to overcome. For example, the initial state of the environment could be partially unknown, agents can act suboptimally and observations could be missing. Approaches that adapt classical planning techniques to goal recognition have previously been proposed but, generally, they assume the initial world state is accurately defined. In this paper, a state is inaccurate if any fluent?s value is unknown or incorrect. Our aim is to develop a goal recognition approach that is as accurate as the current state of the art algorithms and whose accuracy does not deteriorate when the initial state is inaccurately defined. To cope with this complication, we propose solving goal recognition problems by means of an Action Graph. An Action Graph models the dependencies, i.e., order constraints, between all actions rather than just actions within a plan. Leaf nodes correspond to actions and are connected to their dependencies via operator nodes. After generating an Action Graph, the graph?s nodes are labelled with their distance from each hypothesis goal. This distance is based on the number and type of nodes  traversed to reach the node in question from an action node that results in the goal state being reached. For each observation, the goal probabilities are then updated based on either the distance the observed action?s node is from each goal or the change in distance. Our experimental results, for 15 different domains, demonstrate that our approach is robust to inaccuracies within the defined initial state.}

However, many variable stiffness actuators and mechanisms which have been produced so far to control these properties of soft robots are slow, bulky, or require additional complex actuators. This paper presents a novel passive soft joint based upon the intrinsic non-Newtonian behavior of Shear Thickening Fluids (STFs). The joint stiffness is varied by changing the speed at which it is actuated. The joints fabricated for testing have a simple cylindrical structure comprised of a soft silicone shell filled with a STF. Three prototypes with lengths of 20, 40 and 60mm were produced for experimental validation. We characterize the behavior of the joints in compression, expansion and bending, yielding a stiffness variation of more than 5x based on actuation speed in compression testing. This paper is the first step in producing a new category of variable stiffening mechanisms based on STFs which can be incorporated into soft robots without the need for additional actuation. It is envisaged that this new soft joint will find applications in soft manipulators and wearable devices.}

FPGAs offer highly parallel computation, but such computation is difficult to program, both algorithmically and at hardware implementation level.   Programmers of digital signal processing (DSP), machine vision, and neural networks typically work in high level, serial languages such as Python, so would benefit from a tool to automatically convert this code to run on FPGA.   We present a design for a compiler from a serial Python subset to parallel dataflow FPGA, in which the physical connectivity and dataflow of the digital logic mirrors the logical dataflow of the programs.  The subset removes some imperative features from Python and focuses on Python's functional programming elements, which can be more easily compiled into physical digital logic implementations of dataflows.  Some imperative features are retained but interpreted under alternative functional semantics, making them easier to parallelize.  These dataflows can then be pipelined for efficient continuous real-time data processing.  An open-source partial implementation is provided together with a compilable simple neuron program.}

To address this complexity, a novel concept referred to as thing artifact is devised abstracting the roles that things play in an IoT ecosystem. The abstraction focuses on 3 cross-cutting aspects namely, functionality in term of what to perform, lifecycle in term of how to behave, and interaction flow in term of with whom to exchange. Building upon the concept of data artifact commonly used in data-driven business applications design, thing artifacts engage in relations with peers to coordinate their individual behaviors and hence, avoid conflicts that could result from the quality of exchanged data. Putting functionality, lifecycle, interaction flow, and relation together contributes to abstracting IoT ecosystems design.

Explainable AI Planning (XAIP) is a field that involves explaining the outputs, i.e., solution plans produced by AI planning systems to a user. The main goal of a plan explanation is to help humans understand reasoning behind the plans that are produced by the planners. In this paper, we propose an argument scheme-based approach to provide explanations in the domain of AI planning. We present novel argument schemes to create arguments that explain a plan and its key elements; and a set of critical questions that allow interaction between the arguments and enable the user to obtain further information regarding the key elements of the plan. Furthermore, we present a novel dialogue system using the argument schemes and critical questions for providing interactive dialectical explanations.}

The proposed solutions take into account static and dynamic context to predict individual interactions. They exploit an input- and a temporal-attention mechanism, and are tested on medium and long-term time horizons. The first two approaches integrate different relations from the so-called Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) within a state-of-the-art deep neural network to create a symbol-driven neural architecture for predicting spatial interactions. The third approach implements a purely data-driven network for motion prediction, the output of which is post-processed to predict QTC spatial interactions. Experimental results on a popular robot dataset of challenging crowded scenarios show that the purely data-driven prediction approach generally outperforms the other two. The three approaches were further evaluated on a different but related human scenarios to assess their generalisation capability.}

However, the elective harvesting of strawberries is a complicated robotic task forming a few scientific research questions. Most available solutions only deal with a specific picking scenario, for example, picking only a single variety of fruit in isolation. Nonetheless, most economically viable (e.g., high?yielding and/or disease?resistant) varieties of strawberry are grown in dense clusters. The current perception technology in such use cases is inefficient. In this work, we developed a novel system capable of harvesting strawberries with several unique features. These features allow the system to deal with very complex picking scenarios, for example, dense clusters. Our concept of a modular system makes our system reconfigurable to adapt to different picking scenarios. We designed, manufactured, and tested a patented picking head with 2.5?degrees of freedom (two independent mechanisms and one dependent cutting system) capable of removing possible occlusions and harvesting the targeted strawberry without any contact with the fruit flesh to avoid damage and bruising. In addition, we developed a novel perception system to localize strawberries and detect their key points, picking points, and determine their ripeness. For this purpose, we introduced two new data sets. Finally, we tested the system in a commercial strawberry growing field and our research farm with three different strawberry varieties. The results show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed system. The designed picking head was able to remove occlusions and harvest strawberries effectively. The perception system was able to detect and determine the ripeness of strawberries with 95\% accuracy. In total, the system was able to harvest 87\% of all detected strawberries with a success rate of 83\% for all pluckable fruits. We also discuss a series of open research questions in the discussion section.}

Some MoDs use trajectories as input, and some can be built from short, disconnected observations of motion. Robots can use MoDs, for example, for global motion planning, improved localization, or human motion prediction. Accounting for the increasing importance of maps of dynamics, we present a comprehensive survey that organizes the knowledge accumulated in the field and identifies promising directions for future work.

The possibility to have autonomous platforms in the field performing repetitive tasks, such as monitoring or harvesting crops, collides with the difficulties posed by the always-changing appearance of the environment due to seasonality.
With this scope in mind, we report an ongoing effort in the long-term deployment of an autonomous mobile robot in a vineyard, with the main objective of acquiring what we called the Bacchus Long-Term (BLT) Dataset. This dataset consists of multiple sessions recorded in the same area of a vineyard but at different points in time, covering a total of 7 months to capture the whole canopy growth from March until September. The multimodal dataset recorded is acquired with the main focus put on pushing the development and evaluations of different mapping and localisation algorithms for long-term autonomous robots operation in the agricultural domain.  Hence, besides the dataset, we also present an initial study in long-term localisation using four different sessions belonging to four different months with different plant stages. We identify that state-of-the-art localisation methods can only cope partially with the amount of change in the environment, making the proposed dataset suitable to establish a benchmark on which the robotics community can test its methods. On our side, we anticipate two solutions pointed at extracting stable temporal features for improving long-term 4d localisation results.

However, developing robots for selective harvesting presents several technological challenges and raises a range of intriguing scientific questions. This paper provides an overview of the available robotic technologies for the selective harvesting of high-value crops and discusses the latest advancements and challenges in the relevant technology domains, including robotic hardware, robot perception, robot planning, and robot control. Additionally, this paper presents several open research questions that can serve as a research focus for further development in this field.}

        abstract = {Acoustic Soft Tactile (AST) skin is a novel sensing technology that uses deformations of the acoustic channels beneath the sensing surface to predict static normal forces and their contact locations. AST skin functions by sensing the changes in the modulation of the acoustic waves travelling through the channels as they deform due to the forces acting on the skin surface. Our previous study tested different AST skin designs for three discrete sensing points and selected two designs that better predicted the forces and contact locations. This paper presents a study of the sensing capability of these two AST skin designs with continuous sensing points with a spatial resolution of 6 mm. Our findings indicate that the AST skin with a dual-channel geometry outperformed the single-channel type during calibration. The dual-channel design predicted more than 90\% of the forces within a {$\pm$} 3 N tolerance and was 84.2\% accurate in predicting contact locations with {$\pm$} 6 mm resolution. In addition, the dual-channel AST skin demonstrated superior performance in a real-time pushing experiment over an off-the-shelf soft tactile sensor. These results demonstrate the potential of using AST skin technology for real-time force sensing in various applications, such as human-robot
interaction and medical diagnosis.}

        abstract = {Modern computer vision technology plays an increasingly important role in agriculture. Automated monitoring of plants for example is an essential task in several applications, such as high-throughput phenotyping or plant health monitoring. Under external influences like wind, plants typically exhibit dynamic behaviours which reveal important characteristics of their structure and condition. These behaviours, however, are typically not considered by state-of-the-art automated phenotyping methods which mostly observe static plant properties. 
In this paper, we propose an automated system for monitoring oscillatory plant movement from video sequences. We employ harmonic inversion for the purpose of efficiently and accurately estimating the eigenfrequency and damping parameters of individual plant parts. The achieved accuracy is compared against values obtained by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which we use as a baseline. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on different plants and plant parts, like wheat ears, hanging vines, as well as stems and stalks, which exhibit a range of oscillatory motions. By utilising harmonic inversion, we are able to consistently obtain more accurate values for the eigenfrequencies compared to those obtained by DFT. We are furthermore able to directly estimate values for the damping coefficient, achieving a similar accuracy as via DFT-based methods, but without the additional computational effort required for the latter. With the approach presented in this paper, it is possible to obtain estimates of mechanical plant characteristics in an automated manner, enabling novel automated acquisition of novel traits for phenotyping.}
