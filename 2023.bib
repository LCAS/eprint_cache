        abstract = {Here we reflect on how a multi-disciplinary working group explored the ethical complexities of the use of new technologies for data sharing in the food supply chain. We used a three-part process of varied design methods, which included collaborative ideation and speculative scenario development, the creation of design fiction objects, and assessment using the Moral-IT deck, a card-based tool. We present, through the lens of the EPSRC's Framework for Responsible Innovation how processes of anticipation, reflection, engagement and action built a plausible, fictional world in which a data trust uses artificial intelligence (AI) to support data sharing and decision-making across the food supply chain. This approach provides rich opportunities for considering ethical challenges to data sharing as part of a reflexive and engaged responsible innovation approach. We reflect on the value and potential of this approach as a method for engaged (co-)design and responsible innovation.}

        abstract = {Abstract{--}Real-time vision in robotics plays an important role in localising and recognising objects. Recently, deep learning approaches have been widely used in robotic vision. However, most of these approaches have assumed that training and test sets come from similar data distributions, which is not valid in many real world applications. This study proposes an approach to address domain generalisation (i.e. out-of distribution generalisation, OODG) where the goal is to train a model via one or more source domains, that will generalise well to unknown target domains using single stage detectors. All existing approaches which deal with OODG either use slow two stage detectors or operate under the covariate shift assumption which may not be useful for real-time robotics. This is the first paper to address domain generalisation in the context of single stage anchor free object detector FCOS without the covariate shift assumption. We focus on improving the generalisation ability of object detection by proposing new regularisation terms to address the domain shift that arises due to both classification and bounding box regression. Also, we include an additional consistency regularisation term to align the local and global level predictions. The proposed approach is implemented as a Domain Generalised Fully Convolutional One Stage (DGFCOS) detection and evaluated using four object detection datasets which provide domain metadata (GWHD, Cityscapes, BDD100K, Sim10K) where it exhibits a consistent performance improvement over the baselines and is able to run in real-time for robotics.}

        abstract = {Identifying the main features and learning the causal relationships of a dynamic system from time-series of sensor data are key problems in many real-world robot applications. In this paper, we propose an extension of a state-of-the-art causal discovery method, PCMCI, embedding an additional feature-selection module based on transfer entropy. Starting from a prefixed set of variables, the new algorithm reconstructs the causal model of the observed system by considering only the its main features and neglecting those deemed unnecessary for understanding the evolution of the system. We first validate the method on a toy problem, for which the ground-truth model is available, and then on a real-world robotics scenario using a large-scale time-series dataset of human trajectories. The experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms the previous state-of-the-art technique in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing better and faster causal discovery of meaningful models from robot sensor data.}

        abstract = {Thematic analysis is the most commonly used form of qualitative analysis used extensively in educational sciences. While the process is straightforward in the sense that a hermeneutic analysis is conducted so as to detect patterns and assign themes emerging from the data acquired, replicability can be challenging. As a result, there is significant debate about what constitutes reliability and rigour in relation to qualitative coding. Traditional thematic analysis in educational sciences requires the development of a codebook and the recruitment of a research team for intercoder reviewing and code testing. Such a process is often lengthy and infeasible when the number of texts to be analysed increases exponentially. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we use an unsupervised text analysis technique called the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify distinct abstract topics which are then clustered into potential themes. Our results show that thematic analysis in the field of educational sciences using the LDA text analysis technique has prospects of demonstrating rigour and higher thematic coding reliability and validity while offering a valid intra-coder complementary support to the researcher.}

        abstract = {Background: The application of autonomous technology in food supply chains gives rise to a number of ethical considerations associated with the interaction between human and technology, human-technology-plant and human-technology-animal. These considerations and their implications influence technology design, the ways in which technology is applied, how the technology changes food supply chain practices, decision-making and the associated ethical aspects and outcomes.
Scope and approach: Using the concept of reflexive governance, this paper has critiqued existing reflective food-related ethical assessment tools and proposed the structural elements required for reflexive governance architectures which address both the sharing of data, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in food supply chains. 
Key findings and conclusions: Considering the ethical implications of using autonomous technology in real life contexts is challenging. The current approach, focusing on discrete ethical elements in isolation e.g., ethical aspects or outcomes, normative standards or ethically orientated compliance-based business strategies is not sufficient in itself. Alternatively, the application of more holistic, reflexive governance architectures can inform consideration of ethical aspects, potential ethical outcomes, in particular how they are interlinked and/or interdependent, and the need for mitigation at all lifecycle stages of technology and food product conceptualisation, design, realisation and adoption in the food supply chain. This research is of interest to those who are undertaking ethical deliberation on data sharing, and  the use of AI and machine learning in food supply chains.}

        abstract = {Person detection applications based on computer vision techniques often rely on complex Convolutional Neural Networks that require powerful hardware in order achieve good runtime performance. The work of this paper has been developed with the aim of implementing a safety system, based on computer vision algorithms, able to detect people in working environments using an embedded device. Possible applications for such safety systems include remote site monitoring and autonomous mobile robots in warehouses and industrial premises. Similar studies already exist in the literature, but they mostly rely on systems like NVidia Jetson that, with a Cuda enabled GPU, are able to provide satisfactory results. This, however, comes with a significant downside as such devices are usually expensive and require significant power consumption. The current paper instead is going to consider various implementations of computer vision-based person detection on two power-efficient and inexpensive devices, namely Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. In order to do so, some solutions based on off-the-shelf algorithms are first explored by reporting experimental results based on relevant performance metrics. Then, the paper presents a newly-created custom architecture, called eYOLO, that tries to solve some limitations of the previous systems. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the good performance of the proposed approach and suggests ways for further improvement.}

Many work striving for this goal have been emerging with the development of robotics, both hardware and software. Today we believe that an important underpinning of long-term robot autonomy is the ability of robots to learn on site and on-the-fly, especially when they are deployed in changing environments or need to traverse different environments. In this paper, we examine the problem of long-term autonomy from the perspective of robot learning, especially in an online way, and discuss in tandem its premise "data" and the subsequent "deployment".}

Many SBO planners have been proposed, and determining performance differences among these planners for path planning problems can be time-consuming and ambiguous. The probabilistic nature of SBO planners can also complicate this procedure, as different results for the same planning problem can be obtained even in consecutive queries from the same planner. We compare all available SBO planners in OMPL with an automated planning problem generation method designed specifically for outdoor robot navigation scenarios. Several evaluation metrics are chosen, such as the length, smoothness, and success rate of the resulting path, and probability distributions for metrics are presented. With the experimental results obtained, clear recommendations on high-performing planners for mobile robot path planning problems are made, which will be useful to researchers and practitioners in mobile robot planning and navigation.}

Identification of verges with high conservation potential represents a considerable challenge for ecologists, driving the development of automated methods to make up for the shortfall of relevant expertise nationally. Using survey data from 3,900 km of roadside verges alongside publicly available street-view imagery, we present DeepVerge: a deep learning-based method that can automatically survey sections of roadside verge by detecting the presence of positive indicator species. Using images and ground truth survey data from the rural UK county of Lincolnshire, DeepVerge achieved a mean accuracy of 88\% and a mean F1 score of 0.82. Such a method may be used by local authorities to identify new local wildlife sites, and aid management and environmental planning in line with legal and government policy obligations, saving thousands of hours of skilled labour}
