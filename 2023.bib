        abstract = {In this research, we present an end-to-end data-driven pipeline for determining the long-term stability status of objects within a given environment, specifically distinguishing between static and dynamic objects. Understanding object stability is key for mobile robots since longterm stable objects can be exploited as landmarks for long-term localisation. Our pipeline includes a labelling method that utilizes historical data from the environment to generate training data for a neural network. Rather than utilizing discrete labels, we propose the use of point-wise continuous label values, indicating the spatio-temporal stability of individual points, to train a point cloud regression network named S-NET. Our approach is evaluated on point cloud data from two parking lots in the NCLT dataset, and the results show that our proposed solution,  outperforms direct training of a classification model for static vs dynamic object classification.}

        abstract = {Abstract{--}Real-time vision in robotics plays an important role in localising and recognising objects. Recently, deep learning approaches have been widely used in robotic vision. However, most of these approaches have assumed that training and test sets come from similar data distributions, which is not valid in many real world applications. This study proposes an approach to address domain generalisation (i.e. out-of distribution generalisation, OODG) where the goal is to train a model via one or more source domains, that will generalise well to unknown target domains using single stage detectors. All existing approaches which deal with OODG either use slow two stage detectors or operate under the covariate shift assumption which may not be useful for real-time robotics. This is the first paper to address domain generalisation in the context of single stage anchor free object detector FCOS without the covariate shift assumption. We focus on improving the generalisation ability of object detection by proposing new regularisation terms to address the domain shift that arises due to both classification and bounding box regression. Also, we include an additional consistency regularisation term to align the local and global level predictions. The proposed approach is implemented as a Domain Generalised Fully Convolutional One Stage (DGFCOS) detection and evaluated using four object detection datasets which provide domain metadata (GWHD, Cityscapes, BDD100K, Sim10K) where it exhibits a consistent performance improvement over the baselines and is able to run in real-time for robotics.}

        abstract = {Multi-robot systems (MRS) are currently being introduced in many in-field logistics operations in large environments such as warehouses and commercial soft-fruit production. Collision avoidance is a critical problem in MRS as it may introduce deadlocks during the motion planning. In this work, a discretised topological map representation is used for low-cost route planning of individual robots as well as to easily switch the navigation actions depending on the constraints in the environment. However, this topological map could also have bottlenecks which leads to deadlocks and low transportation efficiency when used for an MRS. In this paper, we propose a resource container based Request-Release-Interrupt (RRI) algorithm that constrains each topological node with a capacity of one entity and therefore helps to avoid collisions and detect deadlocks. Furthermore, we integrate a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Discrete Event Simulation (DES) for optimising the topological map to reduce deadlocks and improve transportation efficiency in logistics tasks. Performance analysis of the proposed algorithms are conducted after running a set of simulations with multiple robots and different maps. The results validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.}

Ensuring safety using mobile robots is critical for many real-world applications, especially those in which contact with the robot could result in fatal consequences, such as agricultural environments where a mobile device with an industrial cutter is used for grass-mowing. In this paper, we propose an explicit integration of a risk management process into the design of the software for an autonomous grass mower, with the aim of enhancing safety.

Digitalisation enables firms to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs), address climate change and the wider negative externalities of food production such as biodiversity loss, and diffuse pollution. Digitalising at the business and supply chain level through public-private mechanisms for data exchange affords the opportunity for greater collaboration, visualising and measuring activities and their socio-environmental impact, demonstrating compliance with regulatory and market requirements and providing opportunity to capture current practice and future opportunities for process and product improvement. Herein we consider digitalisation as a tool to drive innovation and transition to a decarbonised food system. We consider that deep decarbonisation of the food system can only occur when trusted emissions data are exchanged across supply chains. This requires fusion of standardised emissions measurements within a supply chain data sharing framework. This framework, likely operating as a corporate entity, would provide the foci for measurement standards, data exchange, trusted and certified data and as a multi-stakeholder body, including regulators, that would build trust and collaboration across supply chains. This approach provides a methodology for accurate and trusted emissions data to inform consumer choice and industrial response of individual firms within a supply chain.}

that typically use attention-based methods to establish semantic associations between objects in an

interdependence, attention-based methods have difficulty in capturing the semantic association between
them. To tackle this problem, additional knowledge beyond the task-specific dataset is often required
to create captions that are more precise and meaningful. In this article, a semantic attention network is
proposed to incorporate general-purpose knowledge into a transformer attention block model. This design
combines visual and semantic properties of internal image knowledge in one place for fusion, serving as
a reference point to aid in the learning of alignments between vision and language and to improve visual
attention and semantic association. The proposed framework is validated on the Microsoft COCO dataset,
and experimental results demonstrate competitive performance against the current state of the art.}

Starting from a prefixed set of variables, the new algorithm reconstructs the causal model of the observed system by considering only the its main features and neglecting those deemed unnecessary for understanding the evolution of the system. We first validate the method on a toy problem, for which the ground-truth model is available, and then on a real-world robotics scenario using a large-scale time-series dataset of human trajectories. The experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms the previous state-of-the-art technique in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing better and faster causal discovery of meaningful models from robot sensor data.}

Despite these difficulties, teleoperated robotic systems are still popular in several industrial applications, e.g., remote handling of hazardous material. In this context, we present a novel haptic shared control method for minimising the manipulator torque effort during remote manipulative actions in which an operator is assisted in selecting a suitable grasping pose for then displacing an object along a desired trajectory. Minimising torque is important because it reduces the system operating cost and extends the range of objects that can be manipulated. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a series of representative real-world pick-and-place experiments as well as in human subjects studies. The reported results prove the effectiveness of our shared control vs. a standard teleoperation approach. We also find that haptic-only guidance performs better than visually guidance, although combining them together leads to the best overall results.}

Traditional thematic analysis in educational sciences requires the development of a codebook and the recruitment of a research team for intercoder reviewing and code testing. Such a process is often lengthy and infeasible when the number of texts to be analysed increases exponentially. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we use an unsupervised text analysis technique called the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify distinct abstract topics which are then clustered into potential themes. Our results show that thematic analysis in the field of educational sciences using the LDA text analysis technique has prospects of demonstrating rigour and higher thematic coding reliability and validity while offering a valid intra-coder complementary support to the researcher.}

These considerations and their implications influence technology design, the ways in which technology is applied, how the technology changes food supply chain practices, decision-making and the associated ethical aspects and outcomes.
Scope and approach: Using the concept of reflexive governance, this paper has critiqued existing reflective food-related ethical assessment tools and proposed the structural elements required for reflexive governance architectures which address both the sharing of data, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in food supply chains. 
Key findings and conclusions: Considering the ethical implications of using autonomous technology in real life contexts is challenging. The current approach, focusing on discrete ethical elements in isolation e.g., ethical aspects or outcomes, normative standards or ethically orientated compliance-based business strategies is not sufficient in itself. Alternatively, the application of more holistic, reflexive governance architectures can inform consideration of ethical aspects, potential ethical outcomes, in particular how they are interlinked and/or interdependent, and the need for mitigation at all lifecycle stages of technology and food product conceptualisation, design, realisation and adoption in the food supply chain. This research is of interest to those who are undertaking ethical deliberation on data sharing, and  the use of AI and machine learning in food supply chains.}

The work of this paper has been developed with the aim of implementing a safety system, based on computer vision algorithms, able to detect people in working environments using an embedded device. Possible applications for such safety systems include remote site monitoring and autonomous mobile robots in warehouses and industrial premises. Similar studies already exist in the literature, but they mostly rely on systems like NVidia Jetson that, with a Cuda enabled GPU, are able to provide satisfactory results. This, however, comes with a significant downside as such devices are usually expensive and require significant power consumption. The current paper instead is going to consider various implementations of computer vision-based person detection on two power-efficient and inexpensive devices, namely Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. In order to do so, some solutions based on off-the-shelf algorithms are first explored by reporting experimental results based on relevant performance metrics. Then, the paper presents a newly-created custom architecture, called eYOLO, that tries to solve some limitations of the previous systems. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the good performance of the proposed approach and suggests ways for further improvement.}

The probabilistic nature of SBO planners can also complicate this procedure, as different results for the same planning problem can be obtained even in consecutive queries from the same planner. We compare all available SBO planners in OMPL with an automated planning problem generation method designed specifically for outdoor robot navigation scenarios. Several evaluation metrics are chosen, such as the length, smoothness, and success rate of the resulting path, and probability distributions for metrics are presented. With the experimental results obtained, clear recommendations on high-performing planners for mobile robot path planning problems are made, which will be useful to researchers and practitioners in mobile robot planning and navigation.}

Through a simple analysis, we demonstrate that MACARONS can operate at a rate sufficient to automate tray loading/unloading, to reduce labour costs in a vertical farm.}

        abstract = {Reconstructing accurate causal models of dynamic systems from time-series of sensor data is a key problem in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present an overview based on our experience about practical challenges that the causal analysis encounters when applied to autonomous robots and how Continual Learning{\texttt{\char126}}(CL) could help to overcome them. We propose a possible way to leverage the CL paradigm to make causal discovery feasible for robotics applications where the computational resources are limited, while at the same time exploiting the robot as an active agent that helps to increase the quality of the reconstructed causal models.}

In this paper, we present a new approach for context reasoning to further advance the field of human motion prediction. We therefore propose a neuro-symbolic approach for human motion prediction (NeuroSyM), which weights differently the interactions in the neighbourhood by leveraging an intuitive technique for spatial representation called Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC). The proposed approach is experimentally tested on medium and long term time horizons using two architectures from the state of art, one of which is  a baseline for human motion prediction and the other is a baseline for generic multivariate time-series prediction. Six datasets of challenging crowded scenarios, collected from both fixed and mobile cameras, were used for testing. Experimental results show that the NeuroSyM approach outperforms in most cases the baseline architectures in terms of prediction accuracy.}

        abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) technologies can overlay digital in- formation onto the real world. This makes them well suited for deci- sion support by providing contextually-relevant information to decision- makers. However, processing large amounts of information simultane- ously, particularly in time-pressured conditions, can result in poor decision- making due to excess cognitive load. This paper presents the results of an exploratory study investigating the effects of AR on cognitive load. A within-subjects experiment was conducted where participants were asked to complete a variable-sized bin packing task with and without the as- sistance of an augmented reality decision support system (AR DSS). Semi-structured interviews were conducted to elicit perceptions about the ease of the task with and without the AR DSS. This was supple- mented by collecting quantitative data to investigate if any changes in perceived ease of the task translated into changes in task performance. The qualitative data suggests that the presence of the AR DSS made the task feel easier to participants; however, there was only a statistically in- significant increase in mean task performance. Analysing the data at the individual level does not provide evidence of a translation of increased perceived ease to increased task performance.}

        abstract = {Grasslands are increasingly modified by anthropogenic activities and species rich grasslands have become rare habitats in the UK. However, grassy roadside verges often contain conservation priority plant species and should be targeted for protection. Identification of verges with high conservation potential represents a considerable challenge for ecologists, driving the development of automated methods to make up for the shortfall of relevant expertise nationally. Using survey data from 3,900 km of roadside verges alongside publicly available street-view imagery, we present DeepVerge: a deep learning-based method that can automatically survey sections of roadside verge by detecting the presence of positive indicator species. Using images and ground truth survey data from the rural UK county of Lincolnshire, DeepVerge achieved a mean accuracy of 88\% and a mean F1 score of 0.82. Such a method may be used by local authorities to identify new local wildlife sites, and aid management and environmental planning in line with legal and government policy obligations, saving thousands of hours of skilled labour}
