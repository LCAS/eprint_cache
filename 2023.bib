        abstract = {Here we reflect on how a multi-disciplinary working group explored the ethical complexities of the use of new technologies for data sharing in the food supply chain. We used a three-part process of varied design methods, which included collaborative ideation and speculative scenario development, the creation of design fiction objects, and assessment using the Moral-IT deck, a card-based tool. We present, through the lens of the EPSRC's Framework for Responsible Innovation how processes of anticipation, reflection, engagement and action built a plausible, fictional world in which a data trust uses artificial intelligence (AI) to support data sharing and decision-making across the food supply chain. This approach provides rich opportunities for considering ethical challenges to data sharing as part of a reflexive and engaged responsible innovation approach. We reflect on the value and potential of this approach as a method for engaged (co-)design and responsible innovation.}

        abstract = {Identifying the main features and learning the causal relationships of a dynamic system from time-series of sensor data are key problems in many real-world robot applications. In this paper, we propose an extension of a state-of-the-art causal discovery method, PCMCI, embedding an additional feature-selection module based on transfer entropy. Starting from a prefixed set of variables, the new algorithm reconstructs the causal model of the observed system by considering only the its main features and neglecting those deemed unnecessary for understanding the evolution of the system. We first validate the method on a toy problem, for which the ground-truth model is available, and then on a real-world robotics scenario using a large-scale time-series dataset of human trajectories. The experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms the previous state-of-the-art technique in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing better and faster causal discovery of meaningful models from robot sensor data.}

        abstract = {Person detection applications based on computer vision techniques often rely on complex Convolutional Neural Networks that require powerful hardware in order achieve good runtime performance. The work of this paper has been developed with the aim of implementing a safety system, based on computer vision algorithms, able to detect people in working environments using an embedded device. Possible applications for such safety systems include remote site monitoring and autonomous mobile robots in warehouses and industrial premises. Similar studies already exist in the literature, but they mostly rely on systems like NVidia Jetson that, with a Cuda enabled GPU, are able to provide satisfactory results. This, however, comes with a significant downside as such devices are usually expensive and require significant power consumption. The current paper instead is going to consider various implementations of computer vision-based person detection on two power-efficient and inexpensive devices, namely Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. In order to do so, some solutions based on off-the-shelf algorithms are first explored by reporting experimental results based on relevant performance metrics. Then, the paper presents a newly-created custom architecture, called eYOLO, that tries to solve some limitations of the previous systems. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the good performance of the proposed approach and suggests ways for further improvement.}

        abstract = {This paper evaluates Sampling-Based Optimizing (SBO) planners from the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) in the context of mobile robot navigation in outdoor environments. Many SBO planners have been proposed, and determining performance differences among these planners for path planning problems can be time-consuming and ambiguous. The probabilistic nature of SBO planners can also complicate this procedure, as different results for the same planning problem can be obtained even in consecutive queries from the same planner. We compare all available SBO planners in OMPL with an automated planning problem generation method designed specifically for outdoor robot navigation scenarios. Several evaluation metrics are chosen, such as the length, smoothness, and success rate of the resulting path, and probability distributions for metrics are presented. With the experimental results obtained, clear recommendations on high-performing planners for mobile robot path planning problems are made, which will be useful to researchers and practitioners in mobile robot planning and navigation.}

        abstract = {The Modular Automated Crop Array Online System (MACARONS) is an extensible, scalable, open hardware system for plant transport in automated horticulture systems such as vertical farms.  It is specified to move trays of plants up to 1060mm \${$\backslash$}times\$ 630mm and 12.5kg at a rate of 100mm/s along the guide rails and 41.7mm/s up the lifts, such as between stations for monitoring and actuating plants. The cost for the construction of one grow unit of MACARONS is 144.96USD which equates to 128.85USD/m\${\^{ }}2\$ of grow area. The designs are released and meets the requirements of CERN-OSH-W, which includes step-by-step graphical build instructions and can be built by a typical technical person in one day at a cost of 1535.50 USD.  Integrated tests are included in the build instructions are used to validate against the specifications, and we report on a successful build.  Through a simple analysis, we demonstrate that MACARONS can operate at a rate sufficient to automate tray loading/unloading, to reduce labour costs in a vertical farm.}
