        abstract = {Developing cherry tomato detection algorithms for selective harvesting robots faces many challenges due to the influence of various environmental factors such as lighting, water mist, overlap, and occlusion. To this end, we present LACTA, a lightweight and accurate cherry tomato detection algorithm specifically designed for harvesting robot operation in complex environments. Our approach enhances the model?s generalization ability and robustness by selectively expanding the original dataset using a combination of offline and online data augmentation strategies. To effectively capture the small target features of cherry tomatoes, we construct an adaptive feature extraction network (AFEN) that focuses on extracting pertinent feature information to enhance the identification ability. Additionally, the proposed cross-layer feature fusion network (CFFN) preserves the model?s lightweight nature while obtaining richer feature representations. Finally, the integration of efficient decoupled heads (EDH) further enhances the model?s detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate the adaptability and robustness of LACTA, achieving precision, recall, and mAP values of 94\%, 92.5\%, and 97.3\%, respectively. Compared to the original dataset, the offline-online combined data augmentation strategy improves precision, recall, and mAP by 1.6\%, 1.7\%, and 1.1\%, respectively. The AFEN + CFFN network structure significantly reduces computational complexity by 28\% and number of parameters by 72\%. With a compact size of only 2.88M, the LACTA model can be seamlessly deployed into selective harvesting robots for the automated harvesting of cherry tomatoes in greenhouses.
