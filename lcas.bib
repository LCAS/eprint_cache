@inproceedings{lirolem8323_Automatic_Recognition_Performances,
    abstract = {Facial expressions are one important nonverbal communication cue, as they can provide feedback in conversations between people and also in human-robot interaction. This paper presents an evaluation of three standard pattern recognition techniques (active appearance models, gabor energy filters, and raw images) for facial feedback interpretation in terms of valence (success and failure) and compares the results to the human performance. The used database contains videos of people interacting with a robot by teaching the names of several objects to it. After teaching, the robot should term the objects correctly. The subjects reacted to its answer while showing spontaneous facial expressions, which were classified in this work. One main result is that an automatic classification of facial expressions in terms of valence using simple standard pattern recognition techniques is possible with an accuracy comparable to the average human classification rate, but with a high variance between different subjects, likewise to the human performance. \^A\\copyright 2010 IEEE.},

    abstract = {Despite the large number of navigation algorithms available for mobile robots, in many social contexts they often exhibit inopportune motion behaviours in proximity of people, often with very \"unnatural\" movements due to the execution of segmented trajectories or the sudden activation of safety mechanisms (e.g., for obstacle avoidance). We argue that the reason of the problem is not only the difficulty of modelling human behaviours and generating opportune robot control policies, but also the way human-robot spatial interactions are represented and implemented.
In this paper we propose a new methodology based on a qualitative representation of spatial interactions, which is both flexible and compact, adopting the well-defined and coherent formalization of Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC). We show the potential of a QTC-based approach to abstract and design complex robot behaviours, where the desired robot's behaviour is represented together with its actual performance in one coherent approach, focusing on spatial interactions rather than pure navigation problems.},

Underlying our approach is the principle that an autonomous system must be motivated to act to gather new knowledge, and to validate and correct existing knowledge. This principle is embodied in Dora, a mobile robot which features the aforementioned techniques: shared representations, non-monotonic reasoning, and goal generation and management. To demonstrate how well this collection of techniques work in real-world situations we present a comprehensive analysis of the Dora system's performance over multiple tours in an indoor environment. In this analysis Dora successfully completed 18 of 21 attempted runs, with all but 3 of these successes requiring one or more of the integrated techniques to recover from problems. \^A\\copyright 2011 IEEE.},

    abstract = {With increasing computational power and decreasing size, computers nowadays are already wearable and mobile. They become attendant of peoples' everyday life. Personal digital assistants and mobile phones equipped with adequate software gain a lot of interest in public, although the functionality they provide in terms of assistance is little more than a mobile databases for appointments, addresses, to-do lists and photos. Compared to the assistance a human can provide, such systems are hardly to call real assistants. The motivation to construct more human-like assistance systems that develop a certain level of cognitive capabilities leads to the exploration of two central paradigms in this work. The first paradigm is termed cognitive vision systems. Such systems take human cognition as a design principle of underlying concepts and develop learning and adaptation capabilities to be more flexible in their application. They are embodied, active, and situated. Second, the ego-vision paradigm is introduced as a very tight interaction scheme between a user and a computer system that especially eases close collaboration and assistance between these two. Ego-vision systems (EVS) take a user's (visual) perspective and integrate the human in the system's processing loop by means of a shared perception and augmented reality. EVSs adopt techniques of cognitive vision to identify objects, interpret actions, and understand the user's visual perception. And they articulate their knowledge and interpretation by means of augmentations of the user's own view. These two paradigms are studied as rather general concepts, but always with the goal in mind to realize more flexible assistance systems that closely collaborate with its users. This work provides three major contributions. First, a definition and explanation of ego-vision as a novel paradigm is given. Benefits and challenges of this paradigm are discussed as well. Second, a configuration of different approaches that permit an ego-vision system to perceive its environment and its user is presented in terms of object and action recognition, head gesture recognition, and mosaicing. These account for the specific challenges identified for ego-vision systems, whose perception capabilities are based on wearable sensors only. Finally, a visual active memory (VAM) is introduced as a flexible conceptual architecture for cognitive vision systems in general, and for assistance systems in particular. It adopts principles of human cognition to develop a representation for information stored in this memory. So-called memory processes continuously analyze, modify, and extend the content of this VAM. The functionality of the integrated system emerges from their coordinated interplay of these memory processes. An integrated assistance system applying the approaches and concepts outlined before is implemented on the basis of the visual active memory. The system architecture is discussed and some exemplary processing paths in this system are presented and discussed.

We recognize seven classes of basic emotions by means of visual analysis of talking faces. In parallel, the audio signal is analyzed on the basis of the intonation of the verbal articulation. We compare the performance of state of the art recognition systems on the DaFEx database for both complement modalities and discuss these results with regard to the theoretical background and possible fusion schemes in real-world multimodal interfaces. \^A\\copyright 2009 IEEE.},

Human-robot interaction is becoming increasingly complex
through the growing number of abilities, both cognitive and
physical, available to today?s robots. At the same time, interaction is still often dif?cult because the users do not understand the robots? internal states, expectations, intentions, and
actions. Vice versa, robots lack understanding of the users?
expectations, intentions, actions, and social signals.},

This paper presents a pattern recognition approach for the interpretation of FCSs in terms of valence, based on the selection of discriminative subsequences in video data. These subsequences capture important temporal dynamics and are used as prototypical reference subsequences in a classification procedure based on dynamic time warping and feature extraction with active appearance models. Using this valence classification, the robot can discriminate positive from negative interaction situations and react accordingly. The approach is evaluated on a database containing videos of people interacting with a robot by teaching the names of several objects to it. The verbal answer of the robot is expected to elicit the display of spontaneous FCSs by the human tutor, which were classified in this work. The achieved classification accuracies are comparable to the average human recognition performance and outperformed our previous results on this task. \^A\\copyright 2013 IEEE.},

We show the appropriateness of our approach by using the probabilistic model to encode different HRSI behaviours observed in a human-robot interaction study and show how the models can be used to classify these behaviours reliably.

In this paper, we present a soft real-time vision system that enables an interactive robot to analyze faces of interaction partners not only to identify them, but also to recognize their respective facial expressions as a dialog-controlling non-verbal cue. In order to assure applicability in real world environments, a robust detection scheme is presented which detects faces and basic facial features such as the position of the mouth, nose, and eyes. Based on these detected features, facial parameters are extracted using active appearance models (AAMs) and conveyed to support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to identify both persons and facial expressions. This paper focuses on four different initialization methods for determining the initial shape for the AAM algorithm and their particular performance in two different classification tasks with respect to either the facial expression DaFEx database and to the real world data obtained from a robot?s point of view.},

To achieve long-term autonomy, the robots would need to understand the environment and how it changes over time. For that, we will have to develop novel approaches to extract 3D shapes, objects, people, and models of activity from sensor data gathered during months of autonomous operation.
So far, the environment models used in mobile robotics have been tailored to capture static scenes and environment variations are largely treated as noise. Therefore, utilization of the static models in ever-changing, real world environments is difficult. We propose to represent the environment?s spatio-temporal dynamics by its frequency spectrum.},

This paper describes concept and technical realization of the used mobile AR-kits and discusses interactive learning and retrieval in office environments, and the active memory infrastructure. The focus is on 3D interaction for pointing in a scene coordinate system. This is achieved by 3D augmented pointing, which combines inside-out tracking for head pose recovery and 3D stereo human-computer interaction. Experimental evaluation shows that the accuracy of this 3D cursor is within a few centimeters, which is sufficient to point at an object in an office. Finally, an application of the cursor in VAMPIRE is presented, where in addition to the mobile system, at least one stationary active camera is used to obtain different views of an object. There are many potential applications, for example an improved view-based object recognition. \^A\\copyright 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Sub- sequently an increased extensibility of the robots? system architectures is needed. The goal is to facilitate a long-time evolution of the integrated system in-line with the scientific progress on the algorithmic level. In this paper we present an approach developed for an event-driven robot architecture, focussing on the coordination and interplay of new abilities and components. Appropriate timing, sequencing strategies, execution guaranties, and process flow synchronisation are taken into account to allow appropriate arbitration and interaction between components as well as between the integrated system and the user. The presented approach features dynamic reconfiguration and global coordination based on simple production rules. These are applied first time in conjunction with flexible representations in global memory spaces and an event-driven architecture. As a result a highly adaptive robot control compared to alternative approaches is achieved, allowing system modification during runtime even within complex interactive human-robot scenarios. },

knowledge transfer between inexperienced users and robots,
the ?learning by interacting? paradigm goes hand in hand
with appropriate representations and learning methods. In this paper we discuss a mixed initiative strategy for robotic learning by interacting with a user in a joint map acquisition process.
We propose the integration of an environment representation
approach into our interactive learning framework. The environment representation and mapping system supports both
user driven and data driven strategies for the acquisition of spatial information, so that a mixed initiative strategy for the learning process is realised. We evaluate our system with test runs according to the scenario of a guided tour, extending the area of operation from structured laboratory environment to
less predictable domestic settings},

@inproceedings{lirolem8320_Dynamic_Path_Planning,
    abstract = {Mobile robots that are employed in people's homes need to safely navigate their environment. And natural human-inhabited environments still pose significant challenges for robots despite the impressive progress that has been achieved in the field of path planning and obstacle avoidance. These challenges mostly arise from the fact that (i) the perceptual abilities of a robot are limited, thus sometimes impeding its ability to see relevant obstacles (e.g. transparent objects), and (ii) the environment is highly dynamic being populated by humans. In this contribution we are making a case for an integrated solution to these challenges that builds upon the analysis and use of implicit human knowledge in path planning and a cascade of replanning approaches. We combine state of the art path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms with the knowledge about how humans navigate in their very own environment. The approach results in a more robust and predictable navigation ability for domestic robots as is demonstrated in a number of experimental runs. \^A\\copyright2010 IEEE.},

These usually influence many of a robot's abilities simultaneously. Hence, when designing robots that users will want to interact with, all components need to be tested in the system context, with real users and real tasks in real interactions. This requires methods that link the analysis of the robot's internal computations within and between components (system level) with the interplay between robot and user (interaction level). This article presents Systemic Interaction Analysis (SInA) as an integrated method to (a) derive prototypical courses of interaction based on system and interaction level, (b) identify deviations from these, (c) infer the causes of deviations by analyzing the system's operational sequences, and (d) improve the robot iteratively by adjusting models and implementations.},

    abstract = {In order to address the problem of failure detection in the robotics domain, we present in this contribution a so-called self-awareness model, based on the system's internal data exchange and the inherent dynamics of inter-component communication. The model is strongly data driven and provides an anomaly detector for robotics systems both applicable in-situ at runtime as well as a-posteriori in post-mortem analysis. Current architectures or methods for failure detection in autonomous robots are either implementations of watch dog concepts or are based on excessive amounts of domain-specific error detection code. The approach presented in this contribution provides an avenue for the detection of more subtle anomalies originating from external sources such as the environment itself or system failures such as resource starvation. Additionally, developers are alleviated from explicitly modeling and foreseeing every exceptional situation, instead training the presented probabilistic model with the known normal modes within the specification of the robot system. As we developed and evaluated the self-awareness model on a mobile robot platform featuring an event-driven software architecture, the presented method can easily be applied in other current robotics software architectures. \^A\\copyright2010 IEEE.},

These subsequences capture important temporal dynamics and are used as prototypical reference subsequences in a classi?cation procedure based on dynamic time warping and feature extraction with active appearance models. Using this valence classi?cation, the robot can discriminate positive from negative interaction situations and react accordingly. The approach is evaluated on a database containing videos of people interacting with a robot by teaching the names of several objects to it. The verbal answer of the robot is expected to elicit the display of spontaneous FCSs by the human tutor, which were classi?ed in this work. The achieved classi?cation accuracies are comparable to the average human recognition performance and outperformed our previous results on this task.},

    note = {Facial communicative signals (FCSs) such as head gestures, eye gaze, and facial expressions can provide useful feedback in conversations between people and also in humanrobot interaction. This paper presents a pattern recognition approach for the interpretation of FCSs in terms of valence, based on the selection of discriminative subsequences in video data. These subsequences capture important temporal dynamics and are used as prototypical reference subsequences in a classi?cation procedure based on dynamic time warping and feature extraction with active appearance models. Using this valence classi?cation, the robot can discriminate positive from negative interaction situations and react accordingly. The approach is evaluated on a database containing videos of people interacting with a robot by teaching the names of several objects to it. The verbal answer of the robot is expected to elicit the display of spontaneous FCSs by the human tutor, which were classi?ed in this work. The achieved classi?cation accuracies are comparable to the average human recognition performance and outperformed our previous results on this task.},

A robot should not only consider social rules with respect to proxemics in communication or in encounter people. It should also be able to signal and understand certain spatial constraints. A first spatial and situational constraint, which this research project currently focuses on, is avoiding each other. This includes not only passing by but also especially making room for each other. Consider a narrow place, e.g. hallways, door frames or a small kitchen. A robot might block the way or drives towards you, pursuing its own goal like you. Humans do not even speak to each other in order to pass by and avoid bumping into each other even if the space is narrow. A first study is currently conducted to find out which behaviour is the most appropriate avoiding strategy and how participants express their wish to pass by. Therefore, a variety of defensive and more offensive avoiding strategies of the robot are applied in experiments.

By combining two variants of QTC that implement different resolutions and switching between them based on distance thresholds we show that we are able to both reduce the complexity of the representation and at the same time enrich QTC with one of the core HRSI concepts: proxemics. Building on this novel integrated QTC model, we propose to represent the joint spatial behaviour of a human and a robot employing a probabilistic representation based on Hidden Markov Models. We show the appropriateness of our approach by encoding different HRSI behaviours observed in a human-robot interaction study and show how the models can be used to represent and classify these behaviours using  social distance-augmented QTC.},

In contrast to typical localisation approaches that rely mainly on static parts of the environment, our approach makes explicit use of information about changes by learning and modelling the spatio-temporal dynamics of the environment where the robot is acting.  The proposed spatio-temporal world model is able to predict environmental changes in time, allowing the robot to improve its localisation capabilities during long-term operations in populated environments. To investigate the proposed approach, we have enabled a mobile robot to autonomously patrol a populated environment over a period of one week while building the proposed model representation. We demonstrate that the experience learned during one week is applicable for topological localization even after a hiatus of three months by showing that the localization error rate is significantly lower compared to static environment representations.},

Our key contribution is to utilise QTC as a state descriptor and model HRSI as a probabilistic sequence of such states. Apart from the sole direction of movements of human and robot modelled by QTC, attributes of HRSI like proxemics and velocity profiles play vital roles for the modelling and generation of HRSI behaviour. In this paper, we particularly present how the concept of proxemics can be embedded in QTC to facilitate richer models. To facilitate reasoning on HRSI with qualitative representations, we show how we can combine the representational power of QTC with the concept of proxemics in a concise framework, enriching our probabilistic representation by implicitly modelling distances. We show the appropriateness of our sequential model of QTC by encoding different HRSI behaviours observed in two spatial interaction experiments. We classify these encounters, creating a comparative measurement, showing the representational capabilities of the model.},

These subsequences capture important temporal dynamics and are used as prototypical reference subsequences in a classification procedure based on dynamic time warping and feature extraction with active appearance models. Using this valence classification, the robot can discriminate positive from negative interaction situations and react accordingly. The approach is evaluated on a database containing videos of people interacting with a robot by teaching the names of several objects to it. The verbal answer of the robot is expected to elicit the display of spontaneous FCSs by the human tutor, which were classified in this work.

    abstract = {The motivation for this research stems from the future vision of being able to buy a mobile service robot for your own household, unpack it, switch it on, and have it behave in an intelligent way; but of course it also has to adapt to your personal preferences over time. My work is focusing on the spatial aspect of the robot?s behaviours, which means when it is moving in a confined, shared space with a human it will also take the communicative character of these movements into account. This adaptation to the users preferences should come from experience which the robot gathers throughout several days or months of interaction and not from a programmer hard-coding certain behaviours},

    abstract = {We present an Augmented Reality (AR) system to support
collaborative tasks in a shared real-world interaction space
by facilitating joint attention. The users are assisted by information about their interaction partner's field of view both visually and acoustically. In our study, the audiovisual improvements are compared with an AR system without these support mechanisms in terms of the participants' reaction times and error rates. The participants performed a simple object-choice task we call the gaze game to ensure controlled experimental conditions. Additionally, we asked the subjects to fill in a questionnaire to gain subjective feedback from them. We were able to show an improvement for both dependent variables as well as positive feedback for the visual augmentation in the questionnaire.},
