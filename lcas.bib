@conference{11577_3373517_Realtime_Object_Detection,
    abstract = {Object detection plays a crucial role in the development of Electronic Travel Aids (ETAs), capable to guide a person with visual impairments towards a target object in an unknown indoor environment. In such a scenario, the object detector runs on a mobile device (e.g. smartphone) and needs to be fast, accurate, and, most importantly, lightweight. Nowadays, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have become the state-of-the-art solution for object detection tasks, with many works improving speed and accuracy by proposing new architectures or extending existing ones. A common strategy is to use deeper networks to get higher performance, but that leads to a higher computational cost which makes it impractical to integrate them on mobile devices with limited computational power. In this work we compare different object detectors to find a suitable candidate to be implemented on ETAs, focusing on lightweight models capable of working in real-time on mobile devices with a good accuracy. In particular, we select two models: SSD Lite with Mobilenet V2 and Tiny-DSOD. Both models have been tested on the popular OpenImage dataset and a new dataset, named L-CAS Office dataset, collected to further test models’ performance and robustness in a real scenario inspired by the actual perception challenges of a user with visual impairments.},

@conference{11577_3455030_Dataset_For_Action,
    abstract = {The development of autonomous robots for agriculture depends on a successful approach to recognize user needs as well as datasets reflecting the characteristics of the domain. Available datasets for 3D Action Recognition generally feature controlled lighting and framing while recording subjects from the front. They mostly reflect good recording conditions and therefore fail to account for the highly variable conditions the robot would have to work with in the field, e.g. when providing in-field logistic support for human fruit pickers as in our scenario. Existing work on Intention Recognition mostly labels plans or actions as intentions, but neither of those fully capture the extend of human intent. In this work, we argue for a holistic view on human Intention Recognition and propose a set of recording conditions, gestures and behaviors that better reflect the environment and conditions an agricultural robot might find itself in. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by means of evaluating two human detection methods: Bounding boxes and skeleton extraction.},

    abstract = {CONSULT is a decision-support framework designed to help patients self-manage chronic conditions and adhere to agreed-upon treatment plans, in collaboration with healthcare professionals. The approach taken employs computational argumentation, a logic-based methodology that provides a formal means for reasoning with evidence by substantiating claims for and against particular conclusions. This paper outlines the architecture of CONSULT, illustrating how facts are gathered about the patient and various preferences of the patient and the clinician(s) involved. A logic-based representation of official treatment guidelines by various public health agencies is presented. Logical arguments are constructed from these facts and guidelines; these arguments are analysed to resolve inconsistencies concerning various treatment options and patient/clinician preferences. The claims of the justified arguments are the decisions recommended by CONSULT. A clinical example is presented which illustrates the use of CONSULT within the context of blood pressure management for secondary stroke prevention. },

Packet filtering firewalls are configured by providing a set of rules that identify how to handle individual data packets that arrive at the firewall. In large firewall configurations, conflicts may arise between these rules. Argumentation provides a way of handling conflicts such that their origin is illuminated, and hence can help a system administrator understand the effects of a given configuration. To show how argumentation might help in this domain we examine the use of a system of metalevel argumentation for firewall configuration, showing how it makes conflicts and their origins clear, and showing how different instantiations of a metalevel argumentation system provide alternative ways to resolve conflicts.},

This is an important rationale to build robots that provide services and assistance in a socially acceptable way and influence societies in a positive way. In the process, methods are needed to rate the robot interaction performance. We present a multimodal corpus of na\"ive users interacting with an autonomously operating system. It comprises data that, to our conviction, reveal a lot about human-robot interaction (HRI) in general and social acceptance, in particular. In both, the evaluation and the design process we took into account Clarkson and Arkin's heuristics for HRI (developed by adapting Nielsen's and Scholtz' heuristics to robotics) 1. We discuss exemplary results to show the use of heuristics in the design of socially acceptable robots.},

    abstract = {With robotic systems entering our daily life, they have to become more flexible and subsuming a multitude of abilities in one single integrated system. Sub- sequently an increased extensibility of the robots? system architectures is needed. The goal is to facilitate a long-time evolution of the integrated system in-line with the scientific progress on the algorithmic level. In this paper we present an approach developed for an event-driven robot architecture, focussing on the coordination and interplay of new abilities and components. Appropriate timing, sequencing strategies, execution guaranties, and process flow synchronisation are taken into account to allow appropriate arbitration and interaction between components as well as between the integrated system and the user. The presented approach features dynamic reconfiguration and global coordination based on simple production rules. These are applied first time in conjunction with flexible representations in global memory spaces and an event-driven architecture. As a result a highly adaptive robot control compared to alternative approaches is achieved, allowing system modification during runtime even within complex interactive human-robot scenarios. },

@conference{11577_3537866_Autonomous_Mobile_Systems,
    abstract = {The ability to perceive traversable regions is a crucial prerequisite for truly autonomous mobile systems. In our previous work [8], we introduced P-SVM, a 3D LiDAR-based traversability analysis system that achieves real-time performance in CPU. However, by design P-SVM does not capture features other than geometric features, limiting its performance and generalizability to complex environments. In this work, we introduce an augmented point cloud descriptor that further improves the performance of P-SVM. By exploiting additional features extracted from remission and height information in the point cloud, our model is able to adapt robustly to strong scene changes. Additionally, in the proposed descriptor, remission radial distribution features are introduced to capture local information around keypoints. This addresses the limitation of P-SVM, which focuses only on global features within the cell. Our new P-SVM2 model demonstrates performance almost on par with state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods on the challenging SemanticKITTI [1] dataset in the traversability analysis task. Notably, P-SVM2 is real-time and relies solely on mobile-level CPUs. Moreover, surprising results have been obtained in robustness and generalizability experiments.},

@article{1d52c1a3eee34259ba7c60fe8b3cc803_Deception_Using_Theory,
    abstract = {Agreement, cooperation and trust would be straightforward if deception did not ever occur in communicative interactions. Humans have deceived one another since the species began. Do machines deceive one another or indeed humans? If they do, how may we detect this? To detect machine deception, arguably requires a model of how machines may deceive, and how such deception may be identified. Theory of Mind (ToM) provides the opportunity to create intelligent machines that are able to model the minds of other agents. The future implications of a machine that has the capability to understand other minds (human or artificial) and that also has the reasons and intentions to deceive others are dark from an ethical perspective. Being able to understand the dishonest and unethical behaviour of such machines is crucial to current research in AI. In this paper, we present a high-level approach for modelling machine deception using ToM under factors of uncertainty and we propose an implementation of this model in an Agent-Oriented Programming Language (AOPL). We show that the Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) paradigm can be used to integrate concepts from two major theories of deception, namely Information Manipulation Theory 2 (IMT2) and Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT), and how to apply these concepts in order to build a model of computational deception that takes into account ToM. To show how agents use ToM in order to deceive, we define an epistemic agent mechanism using BDI-like architectures to analyse deceptive interactions between deceivers and their potential targets and we also explain the steps in which the model can be implemented in an AOPL. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first attempts in AI that (i) uses ToM along with components of IMT2 and IDT in order to analyse deceptive interactions and (ii) implements such a model.},

    abstract = {In argumentation theory, argument schemes are constructs to generalise common patterns of reasoning; whereas critical questions (CQs) capture the reasons why argument schemes might not generate arguments. Argument schemes together with CQs are widely used to instantiate arguments; however when it comes to making decisions, much less attention has been paid to the attacks among arguments. This paper provides a high-level description of the key elements necessary for the formalisation of argumentation frameworks such as argument schemes and CQs. Attack schemes are then introduced to represent attacks among arguments, which enable the definition of domain-specific attacks. One algorithm is articulated to operationalise the use of schemes to generate an argumentation framework, and another algorithm to support decision making by generating domain-specific explanations. Such algorithms can then be used by agents to make recommendations and to provide explanations for humans. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated within the context of a medical case study.},

@conference{11577_3460074_Human_Spatial_Interactions,
    abstract = {Exploiting robots for activities in human-shared environments, whether warehouses, shopping centres or hospitals, calls for such robots to understand the underlying physical interactions between nearby agents and objects. In particular, modelling cause-and-effect relations between the latter can help to predict unobserved human behaviours and anticipate the outcome of specific robot interventions. In this paper, we propose an application of causal discovery methods to model human-robot spatial interactions, trying to understand human behaviours from real-world sensor data in two possible scenarios: humans interacting with the environment, and humans interacting with obstacles. New methods and practical solutions are discussed to exploit, for the first time, a state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithm in some challenging human environments, with potential application in many service robotics scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of the causal models obtained from real-world datasets, we present a comparison between causal and non-causal prediction approaches. Our results show that the causal model correctly captures the underlying interactions of the considered scenarios and improves its prediction accuracy.},

They must provide a strong robustness against internal and external errors or user-dependent application errors. Especially when creating service robots for a variety of applications or robots for accompanying humans in everyday situations sufficient error robustness is crucial for acceptance by users. But experience unveils that operating such systems under real world conditions with unexperienced users is an extremely challenging task which still is not solved satisfactorily. In this paper we will present an approach for handling both internal errors and application errors within an integrated system capable of performing extended HRI on different robotic platforms and in unspecified surroundings like a real world apartment. Based on the gathered experience from user studies and evaluating integrated systems in the real world, we implemented several ways to generalize and handle unexpected situations. Adding such a kind of error awareness to HRI systems in cooperation with the interaction partner avoids to get stuck in an unexpected situation or state and handle mode confusion. Instead of shouldering the enormous effort to account for all possible problems, this paper proposes a more general solution and underpins this with findings from naive user studies. This enhancement is crucial for the development of a new generation of robots as despite diligent preparations might be made, no one can predict how an interaction with a robotic system will develop and which kind of environment it has to cope with.},

    abstract = {Facial expressions are one important nonverbal communication cue, as they can provide feedback in conversations between people and also in human-robot interaction. This paper presents an evaluation of three standard pattern recognition techniques (active appearance models, gabor energy filters, and raw images) for facial feedback interpretation in terms of valence (success and failure) and compares the results to the human performance. The used database contains videos of people interacting with a robot by teaching the names of several objects to it. After teaching, the robot should term the objects correctly. The subjects reacted to its answer while showing spontaneous facial expressions, which were classified in this work. One main result is that an automatic classification of facial expressions in terms of valence using simple standard pattern recognition techniques is possible with an accuracy comparable to the average human classification rate, but with a high variance between different subjects, likewise to the human performance. \^A\\copyright 2010 IEEE.},

    abstract = {Human re-identification is an important feature of domestic service robots, in particular for elderly monitoring and assistance, because it allows them to perform personalized tasks and human-robot interactions. However vision-based re- identification systems are subject to limitations due to human pose and poor lighting conditions. This paper presents a new re-identification method for service robots using thermal images. In robotic applications, as the number and size of thermal datasets is limited, it is hard to use approaches that require huge amount of training samples. We propose a re-identification system that can work using only a small amount of data. During training, we perform entropy-based sampling to obtain a thermal dictionary for each person. Then, a symbolic representation is produced by converting each video into sequences of dictionary elements. Finally, we train a classifier using this symbolic representation and geometric distribution within the new representation domain. The experiments are performed on a new thermal dataset for human re-identification, which includes various situations of human motion, poses and occlusion, and which is made publicly available for research purposes. The proposed approach has been tested on this dataset and its improvements over standard approaches have been demonstrated.},

This goal is often impeded by a lack of knowledge of the human about the internal processing and expectations of the robot and by the inflexibility of the robot to understand open-ended, unconstrained tutoring or demonstration. Hence, we propose mixed-initiative strategies to allow both to mutually contribute to the interactive learning process as
a bi-directional negotiation about knowledge. Along this line this paper discusses two initially different case studies on object manipulation and learning of spatial environments. We present different styles of mixed-
initiative in these scenarios and discuss the merits in each case.},

The system contains several novel elements, in particular: the integration of data from commercial wellness sensors, electronic health records and clinical guidelines; the use of computational argumentation to track the source of data and to resolve conflicts and make recommendations; and argumentation-based dialogue to support interaction with patients. The proposed approach is implemented as an application that can run on smart devices (e.g. tablets). The users have personalised dashboards where they can visualise their health data, and interact with a conversational chatbot providing further explanations about their overall well-being.},

    abstract = {Human detection and tracking is an essential task for service robots, where the combined use of multiple sensors has potential advantages that are yet to be fully exploited. In this paper, we introduce a framework allowing a robot to learn a new 3D LiDAR-based human classifier from other sensors over time, taking advantage of a multisensor tracking system. The main innovation is the use of different detectors for existing sensors (i.e. RGB-D camera, 2D LiDAR) to train, online, a new 3D LiDAR-based human classifier based on a new "trajectory probability". Our framework uses this probability to check whether new detection belongs to a human trajectory, estimated by different sensors and/or detectors, and to learn a human classifier in a semi-supervised fashion. The framework has been implemented and tested on a real-world dataset collected by a mobile robot. We present experiments illustrating that our system is able to effectively learn from different sensors and from the environment, and that the performance of the 3D LiDAR-based human classification improves with the number of sensors/detectors used.},

In particular, we look at clusters of task locations and the positions of team members in relation to cluster centres. In a data-driven approach, we conduct experiments that use two different task allocation mechanisms on the same set of scenarios, providing comparative performance data. We then train a classifier on this data, giving us a method for choosing the best mechanism for a given scenario. We show that selecting a mechanism via this method, compared to using a single state-of-the-art mechanism only, can improve team performance in certain environments, according to our metrics.},

This is particularly relevant for high-value crops, such as strawberries, where harvesting is currently very labour-intensive. As part of a larger project to build a robot that is capable of harvesting strawberries, we have studied the identification of the picking point of strawberries—the point that a robot hand should grasp the strawberry—from images of strawberries. We present a novel approach to identify the picking point and evaluate this approach.},

Personal digital assistants and mobile phones equipped with adequate software gain a lot of interest in public, although the functionality they provide in terms of assistance is little more than a mobile databases for appointments, addresses, to-do lists and photos. Compared to the assistance a human can provide, such systems are hardly to call real assistants. The motivation to construct more human-like assistance systems that develop a certain level of cognitive capabilities leads to the exploration of two central paradigms in this work. The first paradigm is termed cognitive vision systems. Such systems take human cognition as a design principle of underlying concepts and develop learning and adaptation capabilities to be more flexible in their application. They are embodied, active, and situated. Second, the ego-vision paradigm is introduced as a very tight interaction scheme between a user and a computer system that especially eases close collaboration and assistance between these two. Ego-vision systems (EVS) take a user's (visual) perspective and integrate the human in the system's processing loop by means of a shared perception and augmented reality. EVSs adopt techniques of cognitive vision to identify objects, interpret actions, and understand the user's visual perception. And they articulate their knowledge and interpretation by means of augmentations of the user's own view. These two paradigms are studied as rather general concepts, but always with the goal in mind to realize more flexible assistance systems that closely collaborate with its users. This work provides three major contributions. First, a definition and explanation of ego-vision as a novel paradigm is given. Benefits and challenges of this paradigm are discussed as well. Second, a configuration of different approaches that permit an ego-vision system to perceive its environment and its user is presented in terms of object and action recognition, head gesture recognition, and mosaicing. These account for the specific challenges identified for ego-vision systems, whose perception capabilities are based on wearable sensors only. Finally, a visual active memory (VAM) is introduced as a flexible conceptual architecture for cognitive vision systems in general, and for assistance systems in particular. It adopts principles of human cognition to develop a representation for information stored in this memory. So-called memory processes continuously analyze, modify, and extend the content of this VAM. The functionality of the integrated system emerges from their coordinated interplay of these memory processes. An integrated assistance system applying the approaches and concepts outlined before is implemented on the basis of the visual active memory. The system architecture is discussed and some exemplary processing paths in this system are presented and discussed. It assists users in object manipulation tasks and has reached a maturity level that allows to conduct user studies. Quantitative results of different integrated memory processes are as well presented as an assessment of the interactive system by means of these user studies.},

    abstract = {The FP-7 Integrated Project STRANDS [1] is aimed at producing intelligent mobile robots that are able to operate robustly for months in dynamic human environments. To achieve long-term autonomy, the robots would need to understand the environment and how it changes over time. For that, we will have to develop novel approaches to extract 3D shapes, objects, people, and models of activity from sensor data gathered during months of autonomous operation.
So far, the environment models used in mobile robotics have been tailored to capture static scenes and environment variations are largely treated as noise. Therefore, utilization of the static models in ever-changing, real world environments is difficult. We propose to represent the environment?s spatio-temporal dynamics by its frequency spectrum.},

Experiments were conducted with physical robots and simulated robots, and a diverse set of metrics was computed. The experiments were structured to highlight several factors: (a) single-robot versus multi-robot tasks; (b) independent versus dependent (or “constrained”) tasks; and (c) static versus dynamic task allocation modes. Four different task allocation mechanisms were compared, in two different exploration scenarios, with two different starting configurations for the robot team. The results highlight the distinctions between parameterised environments (characterised by the factors above, the robots{\textquoteright} starting positions and the exploration scenario) and the effectiveness of each task allocation mechanism, illustrating that some mechanisms perform statistically better in particular environment parameterisations.},

    abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) must interact with other road users. They must understand and adapt to complex pedestrian behaviour, especially during crossings where priority is not clearly defined. This includes feedback effects such as modelling a pedestrian’s likely behaviours resulting from changes in the AVs behaviour. For example, whether a pedestrian will yield if the AV accelerates, and vice versa. To enable such automated interactions, it is necessary for the AV to possess a statistical model of the pedestrian’s responses to its own actions. A previous work demonstrated a proof-ofconcept method to fit parameters to a simplified model based on data from a highly artificial discrete laboratory task with human subjects. The method was based on LIDAR-based person tracking, game theory, and Gaussian process analysis. The present study extends this method to enable analysis of more realistic continuous human experimental data. It shows for the first time how game-theoretic predictive parameters can be fit into pedestrians natural and continuous motion during road-crossings, and how predictions can be made about their interactions with AV controllers in similar real-world settings.},

@conference{11577_3455203_Task_Success_Classifiers,
    abstract = {Robots learning a new manipulation task from a small amount of demonstrations are increasingly demanded in different workspaces. A classifier model assessing the quality of actions can predict the successful completion of a task, which can be used by intelligent agents for action-selection. This paper presents a novel classifier that learns to classify task completion only from a few demonstrations. We carry out a comprehensive comparison of different neural classifiers, e.g. fully connected-based, fully convolutional-based, sequence2sequence-based, and domain adaptation-based classification. We also present a new dataset including five robot manipulation tasks, which is publicly available. We compared the performances of our novel classifier and the existing models using our dataset and the MIME dataset. The results suggest domain adaptation and timing-based features improve success prediction. Our novel model, i.e. fully convolutional neural network with domain adaptation and timing features, achieves an average classification accuracy of 97.3% and 95.5% across tasks in both datasets whereas state-of-the-art classifiers without domain adaptation and timing-features only achieve 82.4% and 90.3%, respectively.},

The vertical position on the median plan is given by adjusting the tone’s pitch to overcome the audio localisation limitations of bone-conduction headphones.

    abstract = {Many chronic conditions can be better managed bypatients themselves with the use of decision support tools. Thisbecomes even more necessary in the case of multimorbidity (i.e.presence of multiple chronic diseases) or in conditions whereseveral underlying risk factors need to be managed and monitoredin order to avoid relapse or the reoccurrence of an event, like inthe case of stroke. However, despite the fact that these decisionsupport systems are becoming prevalent, little is known about thebest practices in designing for end-users - patients and theircarers. The aim of the present paper is to report on the process ofinvolving users to inform the design of a novel data-driven selfmanagementmobile decision support tool for stroke survivors,called CONSULT. User involvement was facilitated through theuse of a two-phase participatory design approach. During bothphases a total of 44 stakeholders participated, including strokesurvivors, carers, healthcare professionals and researchers. Thepaper documents the findings of the participatory design process,in the form of design recommendations, and describes theirimplications for user interface design.},

    abstract = {Recently, argumentation frameworks have been extended in order to consider trust when defining preferences between arguments, given that arguments (or information that supports the arguments) from more trustworthy sources may be preferred to arguments from less trustworthy sources. Although such literature presents interesting results on argumentation-based reasoning and how agents define preferences between arguments, there is little work taking into account agent strategies for argumentation-based dialogues using such information. In this work, we propose an argumentation framework in which agents consider how much the recipient of an argument trusts others in order to choose the most suitable argument for that particular recipient, i.e., arguments constructed using information from those sources that the recipient trusts. Our approach aims to allow agents to construct more effective arguments, depending on the recipients and on their views on the trustworthiness of potential sources.},

Consider a narrow place, e.g. hallways, door frames or a small kitchen. A robot might block the way or drives towards you, pursuing its own goal like you. Humans do not even speak to each other in order to pass by and avoid bumping into each other even if the space is narrow. A first study is currently conducted to find out which behaviour is the most appropriate avoiding strategy and how participants express their wish to pass by. Therefore, a variety of defensive and more offensive avoiding strategies of the robot are applied in experiments.

An implicit opinion has the stance left unexpressed linguistically while an explicit opinion has the stance expressed explicitly. In this paper, we propose a bipartite graph-based approach to relate a given set of explicit opinions as simplified arguments for a given set of implicit opinions using three different features (a) sentence similarity, (b) sentiment and (c) target. Experiments are carried out on a manually annotated set of explicit-implicit opinions and show that unsupervised sentence representations can be used to accurately match arguments with their corresponding simplified versions.},

    abstract = {Agent-based simulations may be a way to model human society behavior in decisions under risk. However, it is well known in economics that Expected Utility Theory (EUT) is flawed as a descriptive model. In fact, there are some models based on Prospect Theory (PT), that try to provide a better description. If people behave according to PT in finance environments, it is arguable that PT based agents may be a better choice for such environments. We investigate this idea in a specific risky environment, a financial market. We propose an architecture for PT-based agents. Due to some limitations of the original PT, we use an extension of PT called Smooth Prospect Theory (SPT). We simulate artificial markets with PT and traditional (TRA) agents using historical data of many different assets over a period of twenty years. The results showed that SPT-based agents provided behavior that is closer to real market data than TRA agents, and that the improvement when using SPT rather than TRA agents is statiscally significant. It supports the idea that PT based agents may be a better pick to model the behaviour of agents in risky environments.},

CONSULT integrates data from commercial wellness sensors, electronic health records and clinical guidelines and enables users to monitor their vital signs to support self-monitoring and provision of tailored advice. The CONSULT system includes a dashboard and a chatbot. To assess the usability of our system, six volunteers were recruited to interact with CONSULT over a period of seven days. System logs confirmed that participants interacted with the CONSULT system throughout. CONSULT's ability to integrate data from different sensors was an aspect of this systems that all participants liked and kept them motivated to track their vital signs. The study also revealed several usability issues that designers of this type of systems should consider. Some of the most prevalent issues were: information overload, data misinterpretation, need for more anthropomorphic conversational capabilities for the chatbot; lack of visibility of the data transmission status. This paper concludes with reflections on the importance of these findings when assessing the usability of connected health systems, like CONSULT.},

    abstract = {Reasoning on the context of human beings is crucial for many real-world applications especially for those deploying autonomous systems (e.g. robots). In this paper, we present a new approach for context reasoning to further advance the field of human motion prediction. We therefore propose a neuro-symbolic approach for human motion prediction (NeuroSyM), which weights differently the interactions in the neighbourhood by leveraging an intuitive technique for spatial representation called Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC). The proposed approach is experimentally tested on medium and long term time horizons using two architectures from the state of art, one of which is a baseline for human motion prediction and the other is a baseline for generic multivariate time-series prediction. Six datasets of challenging crowded scenarios, collected from both fixed and mobile cameras, were used for testing. Experimental results show that the NeuroSyM approach outperforms in most cases the baseline architectures in terms of prediction accuracy.},

For this, it uses new developments in object detection, mobile computing, action generation and human-computer interfacing to interpret the user's surroundings and present effective guidance directions. Our approach to direction generation uses a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to track the system's state and output the optimal location to be investigated. This system includes an object detector and an audio-based guidance interface to provide a complete active search pipeline. The ActiVis system was evaluated in a set of experiments showing better performance than a simpler unguided case.},

@article{11577_3455200_Distributed_Presynaptic_Connections,
    abstract = {Collision detection is one of the most challenging tasks for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This is especially true for small or micro-UAVs due to their limited computational power. In nature, flying insects with compact and simple visual systems demonstrate their remarkable ability to navigate and avoid collision in complex environments. A good example of this is provided by locusts. They can avoid collisions in a dense swarm through the activity of a motion-based visual neuron called the Lobula giant movement detector (LGMD). The defining feature of the LGMD neuron is its preference for looming. As a flying insect's visual neuron, LGMD is considered to be an ideal basis for building UAV's collision detecting system. However, existing LGMD models cannot distinguish looming clearly from other visual cues, such as complex background movements caused by UAV agile flights. To address this issue, we proposed a new model implementing distributed spatial-temporal synaptic interactions, which is inspired by recent findings in locusts' synaptic morphology. We first introduced the locally distributed excitation to enhance the excitation caused by visual motion with preferred velocities. Then, radially extending temporal latency for inhibition is incorporated to compete with the distributed excitation and selectively suppress the nonpreferred visual motions. This spatial-temporal competition between excitation and inhibition in our model is, therefore, tuned to preferred image angular velocity representing looming rather than background movements with these distributed synaptic interactions. Systematic experiments have been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed model for UAV agile flights. The results have demonstrated that this new model enhances the looming selectivity in complex flying scenes considerably and has the potential to be implemented on embedded collision detection systems for small or micro-UAVs.},

@article{3d20e40823e0401283afa019d6fa0d7f_Probabilistic_Argumentation_Model,
    abstract = {In real-world applications, knowledge bases consisting of all the available information for a specific domain, along with the current state of affairs, will typically contain contradictory data, coming from different sources, as well as data with varying degrees of uncertainty attached. An important aspect of the effort associated with maintaining such knowledge bases is deciding what information is no longer useful; pieces of information may be outdated; may come from sources that have recently been discovered to be of low quality; or abundant evidence may be available that contradicts them. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic structured argumentation framework that arises from the extension of Presumptive Defeasible Logic Programming (PreDeLP) with probabilistic models, and argue that this formalism is capable of addressing these basic issues. The formalism is capable of handling contradictory and uncertain data, and we study non-prioritized belief revision over probabilistic PreDeLP programs that can help with knowledge-base maintenance. For belief revision, we propose a set of rationality postulates — based on well-known ones developed for classical knowledge bases — that characterize how these belief revision operations should behave, and study classes of operators along with theoretical relationships with the proposed postulates, including representation theorems stating the equivalence between classes of operators and their associated postulates. We then demonstrate how our framework can be used to address the attribution problem in cyber security/cyber warfare.},

    abstract = {In nature, lightweight and low-powered insects are ideal model systems to study motion perception strategies. Understanding the underlying characteristics and functionality of insects' visual systems is not only attractive to neural system modellers but also critical in providing effective solutions to future robotics. This paper presents a novel modelling of dynamic vision system inspired by Drosophila physiology for mimicking fast motion tracking and a closed-loop behavioural response to fixation. The proposed model was realised on the embedded system in an autonomous micro robot which has limited computational resources. A monocular camera was applied as the only motion sensing modality. Systematic experiments including open-loop and closed-loop bio-robotic tests validated the proposed visual fixation model: the robot showed motion tracking and fixation behaviours similarly to insects; the image processing frequency can maintain 25 45Hz. Arena tests also demonstrated a successful following behaviour aroused by fixation in navigation.},

@article{e5ffd1633e914ee4b3ffe69ebd1cc21f_Abstract_Argumentation,
    abstract = {Argumentation is an important approach in artificial intelligence and multiagent systems, providing a basis for single agents to make rational decisions, and for groups of agents to reach agreements, as well as a mechanism to underpin a wide range of agent interactions. In such work, a crucial role is played by the notion of \emph{attack} between arguments, and the notion of attack is well-studied. There is, for example, a range of different approaches to identifying which of a set of arguments should be accepted given the attacks between them. Less well studied is the notion of support between arguments, yet the idea that one argument may support another is very intuitive and seems particularly relevant in the area of decision-making where decision options may have multiple arguments for and against them. In the last decade, the study of support in argumentation has regained attention among researchers, but most approaches address support in the context of abstract argumentation where the elements from which arguments are composed are ignored. In contrast, this paper studies the notion of support between arguments in the context of structured argumentation systems where the elements from which arguments are composed play a crucial role. Different forms of support are presented, each of which takes into account the structure of arguments; and the relationships between these forms of support are studied. Then, the paper investigates whether there is a correspondence between the structured and abstract forms of support, and determines whether the abstract formalisms may be instantiated using concrete forms of support in terms of structured arguments. The conclusion is that support in structured argumentation does not mesh well with support in abstract argumentation, and this suggests that more work is required to develop forms of support in abstract argumentation that model what happens in structured argumentation.},

In this paper we present an approach developed for an event-driven robot architecture, focussing on the coordination and interplay of new abilities and components. Appropriate timing, sequencing strategies, execution guaranties, and process flow synchronization are taken into account to allow appropriate arbitration and interaction between components as well as between the integrated system and the user. The presented approach features dynamic reconfiguration and global coordination based on simple production rules. These are applied fist time in conjunction with flexible representations in global memory spaces and an event-driven architecture.

@article{1b14802ef92745dc8a93e2c2f1bd88cc_Argumentation_Enabling_Collective,
    abstract = {Argumentation-based debates are mechanisms that a group can use to resolve conflicting opinions and hence reach agreement. They have many potential applications in on-line communities and other open environments. In this paper, we provide computational infrastructure to support argumentation-based debates, in particular focusing on the problem of how participants in a debate can reach agreement about the outcome of the debate, given all the statements that have been made. Our approach makes it possible to represent arguments that are put forward by the participants in a debate, allows both positive and negative relationships between the arguments to be represented, and makes it possible for participants to express opinions about both the arguments and the outcome of the debate. Our main contribution is to provide a novel method --- indeed the first method--- for computing the collective decision that emerges from the combination of a set of arguments and a set of opinions about whether the arguments hold or not. To do this, we carry out a formal investigation of a family of aggregation functions. This family starts with a function that is firmly rooted in the social choice literature, and is extended with functions that are more oriented towards the use of argumentation. We prove that to ensure that the collective decision is coherent, a property that we think is essential, an aggregation function needs to take into account the dependencies between arguments. We also provide an empirical analysis of the performance of our approach to reaching a collective decision, showing that a collective decision can be reached for debates, of the size that one currently finds online, in reasonable time.},
