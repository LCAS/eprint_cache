This paper presents an evaluation of three standard pattern recognition techniques (active appearance models, gabor energy filters, and raw images) for facial feedback interpretation in terms of valence (success and failure) and compares the results to the human performance. The used database contains videos of people interacting with a robot by teaching the names of several objects to it. After teaching, the robot should term the objects correctly. The subjects reacted to its answer while showing spontaneous facial expressions, which were classified in this work. One main result is that an automatic classification of facial expressions in terms of valence using simple standard pattern recognition techniques is possible with an accuracy comparable to the average human classification rate, but with a high variance between different subjects, likewise to the human performance. \\^A\\\\copyright 2010 IEEE.}}\n\n",

Gesture recognition, context awareness, and grounding\r\nconcepts in the commonly perceived environment as well as in the interaction history are key abilities of such systems.\r\nSimultaneously, recent computer vision research has indicated that integrated systems which are embedded in the world\r\nand interact with their environment seem a prerequisite for solving more general vision tasks. Cognitive computer vision\r\nsystems which enable the generation of knowledge on the basis of perception, reasoning, and extension of prior models\r\nare a major step towards this goal. For these, the integration, interaction and organization of memory becomes a key\r\nissue in system design. In this article we will present a computational framework for integrated vision systems that is\r\ncentered around an active memory component.

Sub- sequently an increased extensibility of the robots? system architectures is needed. The goal is to facilitate a long-time evolution of the integrated system in-line with the scientific progress on the algorithmic level. In this paper we present an approach developed for an event-driven robot architecture, focussing on the coordination and interplay of new abilities and components. Appropriate timing, sequencing strategies, execution guaranties, and process flow synchronisation are taken into account to allow appropriate arbitration and interaction between components as well as between the integrated system and the user. The presented approach features dynamic reconfiguration and global coordination based on simple production rules. These are applied first time in conjunction with flexible representations in global memory spaces and an event-driven architecture. As a result a highly adaptive robot control compared to alternative approaches is achieved, allowing system modification during runtime even within complex interactive human-robot scenarios. }}\n\n",

In this paper, we propose an application of causal discovery methods to model human-robot spatial interactions, trying to understand human behaviours from real-world sensor data in two possible scenarios: humans interacting with the environment, and humans interacting with obstacles. New methods and practical solutions are discussed to exploit, for the first time, a state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithm in some challenging human environments, with potential application in many service robotics scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of the causal models obtained from real-world datasets, we present a comparison between causal and non-causal prediction approaches.

A previous work demonstrated a proof-ofconcept method to fit parameters to a simplified model based on data from a highly artificial discrete laboratory task with human subjects. The method was based on LIDAR-based person tracking, game theory, and Gaussian process analysis. The present study extends this method to enable analysis of more realistic continuous human experimental data.

This is especially true for small or micro-UAVs due to their limited computational power. In nature, flying insects with compact and simple visual systems demonstrate their remarkable ability to navigate and avoid collision in complex environments. A good example of this is provided by locusts. They can avoid collisions in a dense swarm through the activity of a motion-based visual neuron called the Lobula giant movement detector (LGMD). The defining feature of the LGMD neuron is its preference for looming. As a flying insect's visual neuron, LGMD is considered to be an ideal basis for building UAV's collision detecting system. However, existing LGMD models cannot distinguish looming clearly from other visual cues, such as complex background movements caused by UAV agile flights. To address this issue, we proposed a new model implementing distributed spatial-temporal synaptic interactions, which is inspired by recent findings in locusts' synaptic morphology. We first introduced the locally distributed excitation to enhance the excitation caused by visual motion with preferred velocities. Then, radially extending temporal latency for inhibition is incorporated to compete with the distributed excitation and selectively suppress the nonpreferred visual motions. This spatial-temporal competition between excitation and inhibition in our model is, therefore, tuned to preferred image angular velocity representing looming rather than background movements with these distributed synaptic interactions.

In this work, we introduce an augmented point cloud descriptor that further improves the performance of P-SVM. By exploiting additional features extracted from remission and height information in the point cloud, our model is able to adapt robustly to strong scene changes. Additionally, in the proposed descriptor, remission radial distribution features are introduced to capture local information around keypoints. This addresses the limitation of P-SVM, which focuses only on global features within the cell. Our new P-SVM2 model demonstrates performance almost on par with state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods on the challenging SemanticKITTI [1] dataset in the traversability analysis task. Notably, P-SVM2 is real-time and relies solely on mobile-level CPUs.

This paper presents a new re-identification method for service robots using thermal images. In robotic applications, as the number and size of thermal datasets is limited, it is hard to use approaches that require huge amount of training samples. We propose a re-identification system that can work using only a small amount of data. During training, we perform entropy-based sampling to obtain a thermal dictionary for each person. Then, a symbolic representation is produced by converting each video into sequences of dictionary elements. Finally, we train a classifier using this symbolic representation and geometric distribution within the new representation domain. The experiments are performed on a new thermal dataset for human re-identification, which includes various situations of human motion, poses and occlusion, and which is made publicly available for research purposes.

A common strategy is to use deeper networks to get higher performance, but that leads to a higher computational cost which makes it impractical to integrate them on mobile devices with limited computational power. In this work we compare different object detectors to find a suitable candidate to be implemented on ETAs, focusing on lightweight models capable of working in real-time on mobile devices with a good accuracy. In particular, we select two models: SSD Lite with Mobilenet V2 and Tiny-DSOD. Both models have been tested on the popular OpenImage dataset and a new dataset, named L-CAS Office dataset, collected to further test models\u2019 performance and robustness in a real scenario inspired by the actual perception challenges of a user with visual impairments.},\n\tkeywords = {Object detection, real-time, electronic travel aid},\n\tdoi = {10.1109/IPAS50080.2020.9334933},\n\tisbn = {978-1-7281-7575-1},\t\n\tpages = {89--95}\n}\n",

However, it is well known in economics that Expected Utility Theory (EUT) is flawed as a descriptive model. In fact, there are some models based on Prospect Theory (PT), that try to provide a better description. If people behave according to PT in finance environments, it is arguable that PT based agents may be a better choice for such environments. We investigate this idea in a specific risky environment, a financial market. We propose an architecture for PT-based agents. Due to some limitations of the original PT, we use an extension of PT called Smooth Prospect Theory (SPT). We simulate artificial markets with PT and traditional (TRA) agents using historical data of many different assets over a period of twenty years. The results showed that SPT-based agents provided behavior that is closer to real market data than TRA agents, and that the improvement when using SPT rather than TRA agents is statiscally significant.

An important aspect of the effort associated with maintaining such knowledge bases is deciding what information is no longer useful; pieces of information may be outdated; may come from sources that have recently been discovered to be of low quality; or abundant evidence may be available that contradicts them. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic structured argumentation framework that arises from the extension of Presumptive Defeasible Logic Programming (PreDeLP) with probabilistic models, and argue that this formalism is capable of addressing these basic issues. The formalism is capable of handling contradictory and uncertain data, and we study non-prioritized belief revision over probabilistic PreDeLP programs that can help with knowledge-base maintenance. For belief revision, we propose a set of rationality postulates \u2014 based on well-known ones developed for classical knowledge bases \u2014 that characterize how these belief revision operations should behave, and study classes of operators along with theoretical relationships with the proposed postulates, including representation theorems stating the equivalence between classes of operators and their associated postulates.

In this paper, we provide computational infrastructure to support argumentation-based debates, in particular focusing on the problem of how participants in a debate can reach agreement about the outcome of the debate, given all the statements that have been made. Our approach makes it possible to represent arguments that are put forward by the participants in a debate, allows both positive and negative relationships between the arguments to be represented, and makes it possible for participants to express opinions about both the arguments and the outcome of the debate. Our main contribution is to provide a novel method --- indeed the first method--- for computing the collective decision that emerges from the combination of a set of arguments and a set of opinions about whether the arguments hold or not. To do this, we carry out a formal investigation of a family of aggregation functions. This family starts with a function that is firmly rooted in the social choice literature, and is extended with functions that are more oriented towards the use of argumentation. We prove that to ensure that the collective decision is coherent, a property that we think is essential, an aggregation function needs to take into account the dependencies between arguments. We also provide an empirical analysis of the performance of our approach to reaching a collective decision, showing that a collective decision can be reached for debates, of the size that one currently finds online, in reasonable time.\",\n  author    = \"{Ganzer Ripoll}, Jordi and Natalia Criado and Maite Lopez-Sanchez and Simon Parsons and Rodriguez-Aguilar, {Juan A.}\",\n  year      = \"2018\",\n  month     = oct,\n  day       = \"25\",\n  doi       = \"10.1007/s10726-018-9594-6\",\n  language  = \"English\",\n  volume    = \"28\",\n  pages     = \"127\u2013173\",\n  journal   = \"GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION\",\n  issn      = \"0926-2644\",\n  publisher = \"Springer Netherlands\",\n}",

In such work, a crucial role is played by the notion of \\emph{attack} between arguments, and the notion of attack is well-studied. There is, for example, a range of different approaches to identifying which of a set of arguments should be accepted given the attacks between them. Less well studied is the notion of support between arguments, yet the idea that one argument may support another is very intuitive and seems particularly relevant in the area of decision-making where decision options may have multiple arguments for and against them. In the last decade, the study of support in argumentation has regained attention among researchers, but most approaches address support in the context of abstract argumentation where the elements from which arguments are composed are ignored. In contrast, this paper studies the notion of support between arguments in the context of structured argumentation systems where the elements from which arguments are composed play a crucial role. Different forms of support are presented, each of which takes into account the structure of arguments; and the relationships between these forms of support are studied. Then, the paper investigates whether there is a correspondence between the structured and abstract forms of support, and determines whether the abstract formalisms may be instantiated using concrete forms of support in terms of structured arguments. The conclusion is that support in structured argumentation does not mesh well with support in abstract argumentation, and this suggests that more work is required to develop forms of support in abstract argumentation that model what happens in structured argumentation.\",\n  author    = \"Andrea Cohen and Parsons, {Simon Dominic} and Sklar, {Elizabeth I.} and Peter McBurney\",\n  year      = \"2018\",\n  month     = mar,\n  doi       = \"10.1016/j.ijar.2017.12.008\",\n  language  = \"English\",\n  journal   = \"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING\",\n  issn      = \"0888-613X\",\n  publisher = \"Elsevier Inc.\",\n}",

Humans have deceived one another since the species began. Do machines deceive one another or indeed humans? If they do, how may we detect this? To detect machine deception, arguably requires a model of how machines may deceive, and how such deception may be identified. Theory of Mind (ToM) provides the opportunity to create intelligent machines that are able to model the minds of other agents. The future implications of a machine that has the capability to understand other minds (human or artificial) and that also has the reasons and intentions to deceive others are dark from an ethical perspective. Being able to understand the dishonest and unethical behaviour of such machines is crucial to current research in AI. In this paper, we present a high-level approach for modelling machine deception using ToM under factors of uncertainty and we propose an implementation of this model in an Agent-Oriented Programming Language (AOPL). We show that the Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) paradigm can be used to integrate concepts from two major theories of deception, namely Information Manipulation Theory 2 (IMT2) and Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT), and how to apply these concepts in order to build a model of computational deception that takes into account ToM. To show how agents use ToM in order to deceive, we define an epistemic agent mechanism using BDI-like architectures to analyse deceptive interactions between deceivers and their potential targets and we also explain the steps in which the model can be implemented in an AOPL. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first attempts in AI that (i) uses ToM along with components of IMT2 and IDT in order to analyse deceptive interactions and (ii) implements such a model.\",\n  keywords  = \"agent-oriented programming languages, Deception, machine deception, theory of mind\",\n  author    = \"Stefan Sarkadi and Panisson, {Alison R.} and Bordini, {Rafael H.} and McBurney, {Peter John} and Parsons, {Simon Dominic} and Chapman, {Martin David}\",\n  year      = \"2019\",\n  doi       = \"10.3233/AIC-190615\",\n  language  = \"English\",\n  volume    = \"32\",\n  pages     = \"287--302\",\n  journal   = \"AI COMMUNICATIONS\",\n  issn      = \"0921-7126\",\n  publisher = \"IOS Press\",\n  number    = \"4\",\n}",
