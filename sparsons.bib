An implicit opinion has the stance left unexpressed linguistically while an explicit opinion has the stance expressed explicitly. In this paper, we propose a bipartite graph-based approach to relate a given set of explicit opinions as simplified arguments for a given set of implicit opinions using three different features (a) sentence similarity, (b) sentiment and (c) target. Experiments are carried out on a manually annotated set of explicit-implicit opinions and show that unsupervised sentence representations can be used to accurately match arguments with their corresponding simplified versions.},

    abstract = {Agent-based simulations may be a way to model human society behavior in decisions under risk. However, it is well known in economics that Expected Utility Theory (EUT) is flawed as a descriptive model. In fact, there are some models based on Prospect Theory (PT), that try to provide a better description. If people behave according to PT in finance environments, it is arguable that PT based agents may be a better choice for such environments. We investigate this idea in a specific risky environment, a financial market. We propose an architecture for PT-based agents. Due to some limitations of the original PT, we use an extension of PT called Smooth Prospect Theory (SPT). We simulate artificial markets with PT and traditional (TRA) agents using historical data of many different assets over a period of twenty years. The results showed that SPT-based agents provided behavior that is closer to real market data than TRA agents, and that the improvement when using SPT rather than TRA agents is statiscally significant. It supports the idea that PT based agents may be a better pick to model the behaviour of agents in risky environments.},

    abstract = {In argumentation theory, argument schemes are constructs to generalise common patterns of reasoning; whereas critical questions (CQs) capture the reasons why argument schemes might not generate arguments. Argument schemes together with CQs are widely used to instantiate arguments; however when it comes to making decisions, much less attention has been paid to the attacks among arguments. This paper provides a high-level description of the key elements necessary for the formalisation of argumentation frameworks such as argument schemes and CQs. Attack schemes are then introduced to represent attacks among arguments, which enable the definition of domain-specific attacks. One algorithm is articulated to operationalise the use of schemes to generate an argumentation framework, and another algorithm to support decision making by generating domain-specific explanations. Such algorithms can then be used by agents to make recommendations and to provide explanations for humans. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated within the context of a medical case study.},

The CONSULT system includes a dashboard and a chatbot. To assess the usability of our system, six volunteers were recruited to interact with CONSULT over a period of seven days. System logs confirmed that participants interacted with the CONSULT system throughout. CONSULT's ability to integrate data from different sensors was an aspect of this systems that all participants liked and kept them motivated to track their vital signs. The study also revealed several usability issues that designers of this type of systems should consider. Some of the most prevalent issues were: information overload, data misinterpretation, need for more anthropomorphic conversational capabilities for the chatbot; lack of visibility of the data transmission status. This paper concludes with reflections on the importance of these findings when assessing the usability of connected health systems, like CONSULT.},

@article{e5ffd1633e914ee4b3ffe69ebd1cc21f_Abstract_Argumentation,
    abstract = {Argumentation is an important approach in artificial intelligence and multiagent systems, providing a basis for single agents to make rational decisions, and for groups of agents to reach agreements, as well as a mechanism to underpin a wide range of agent interactions. In such work, a crucial role is played by the notion of \emph{attack} between arguments, and the notion of attack is well-studied. There is, for example, a range of different approaches to identifying which of a set of arguments should be accepted given the attacks between them. Less well studied is the notion of support between arguments, yet the idea that one argument may support another is very intuitive and seems particularly relevant in the area of decision-making where decision options may have multiple arguments for and against them. In the last decade, the study of support in argumentation has regained attention among researchers, but most approaches address support in the context of abstract argumentation where the elements from which arguments are composed are ignored. In contrast, this paper studies the notion of support between arguments in the context of structured argumentation systems where the elements from which arguments are composed play a crucial role. Different forms of support are presented, each of which takes into account the structure of arguments; and the relationships between these forms of support are studied. Then, the paper investigates whether there is a correspondence between the structured and abstract forms of support, and determines whether the abstract formalisms may be instantiated using concrete forms of support in terms of structured arguments. The conclusion is that support in structured argumentation does not mesh well with support in abstract argumentation, and this suggests that more work is required to develop forms of support in abstract argumentation that model what happens in structured argumentation.},

@article{3d20e40823e0401283afa019d6fa0d7f_Probabilistic_Argumentation_Model,
    abstract = {In real-world applications, knowledge bases consisting of all the available information for a specific domain, along with the current state of affairs, will typically contain contradictory data, coming from different sources, as well as data with varying degrees of uncertainty attached. An important aspect of the effort associated with maintaining such knowledge bases is deciding what information is no longer useful; pieces of information may be outdated; may come from sources that have recently been discovered to be of low quality; or abundant evidence may be available that contradicts them. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic structured argumentation framework that arises from the extension of Presumptive Defeasible Logic Programming (PreDeLP) with probabilistic models, and argue that this formalism is capable of addressing these basic issues. The formalism is capable of handling contradictory and uncertain data, and we study non-prioritized belief revision over probabilistic PreDeLP programs that can help with knowledge-base maintenance. For belief revision, we propose a set of rationality postulates — based on well-known ones developed for classical knowledge bases — that characterize how these belief revision operations should behave, and study classes of operators along with theoretical relationships with the proposed postulates, including representation theorems stating the equivalence between classes of operators and their associated postulates. We then demonstrate how our framework can be used to address the attribution problem in cyber security/cyber warfare.},

@article{1d52c1a3eee34259ba7c60fe8b3cc803_Deception_Using_Theory,
    abstract = {Agreement, cooperation and trust would be straightforward if deception did not ever occur in communicative interactions. Humans have deceived one another since the species began. Do machines deceive one another or indeed humans? If they do, how may we detect this? To detect machine deception, arguably requires a model of how machines may deceive, and how such deception may be identified. Theory of Mind (ToM) provides the opportunity to create intelligent machines that are able to model the minds of other agents. The future implications of a machine that has the capability to understand other minds (human or artificial) and that also has the reasons and intentions to deceive others are dark from an ethical perspective. Being able to understand the dishonest and unethical behaviour of such machines is crucial to current research in AI. In this paper, we present a high-level approach for modelling machine deception using ToM under factors of uncertainty and we propose an implementation of this model in an Agent-Oriented Programming Language (AOPL). We show that the Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) paradigm can be used to integrate concepts from two major theories of deception, namely Information Manipulation Theory 2 (IMT2) and Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT), and how to apply these concepts in order to build a model of computational deception that takes into account ToM. To show how agents use ToM in order to deceive, we define an epistemic agent mechanism using BDI-like architectures to analyse deceptive interactions between deceivers and their potential targets and we also explain the steps in which the model can be implemented in an AOPL. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first attempts in AI that (i) uses ToM along with components of IMT2 and IDT in order to analyse deceptive interactions and (ii) implements such a model.},

Four different task allocation mechanisms were compared, in two different exploration scenarios, with two different starting configurations for the robot team. The results highlight the distinctions between parameterised environments (characterised by the factors above, the robots{\textquoteright} starting positions and the exploration scenario) and the effectiveness of each task allocation mechanism, illustrating that some mechanisms perform statistically better in particular environment parameterisations.},

    abstract = {Argumentation-based debates are mechanisms that a group can use to resolve conflicting opinions and hence reach agreement. They have many potential applications in on-line communities and other open environments. In this paper, we provide computational infrastructure to support argumentation-based debates, in particular focusing on the problem of how participants in a debate can reach agreement about the outcome of the debate, given all the statements that have been made. Our approach makes it possible to represent arguments that are put forward by the participants in a debate, allows both positive and negative relationships between the arguments to be represented, and makes it possible for participants to express opinions about both the arguments and the outcome of the debate. Our main contribution is to provide a novel method --- indeed the first method--- for computing the collective decision that emerges from the combination of a set of arguments and a set of opinions about whether the arguments hold or not. To do this, we carry out a formal investigation of a family of aggregation functions. This family starts with a function that is firmly rooted in the social choice literature, and is extended with functions that are more oriented towards the use of argumentation. We prove that to ensure that the collective decision is coherent, a property that we think is essential, an aggregation function needs to take into account the dependencies between arguments. We also provide an empirical analysis of the performance of our approach to reaching a collective decision, showing that a collective decision can be reached for debates, of the size that one currently finds online, in reasonable time.},

    abstract = {Many chronic conditions can be better managed bypatients themselves with the use of decision support tools. Thisbecomes even more necessary in the case of multimorbidity (i.e.presence of multiple chronic diseases) or in conditions whereseveral underlying risk factors need to be managed and monitoredin order to avoid relapse or the reoccurrence of an event, like inthe case of stroke. However, despite the fact that these decisionsupport systems are becoming prevalent, little is known about thebest practices in designing for end-users - patients and theircarers. The aim of the present paper is to report on the process ofinvolving users to inform the design of a novel data-driven selfmanagementmobile decision support tool for stroke survivors,called CONSULT. User involvement was facilitated through theuse of a two-phase participatory design approach. During bothphases a total of 44 stakeholders participated, including strokesurvivors, carers, healthcare professionals and researchers. Thepaper documents the findings of the participatory design process,in the form of design recommendations, and describes theirimplications for user interface design.},

    abstract = {The work presented here investigates how environmental features can be used to help select a task allocation mechanism from a portfolio in a multi-robot exploration scenario. In particular, we look at clusters of task locations and the positions of team members in relation to cluster centres. In a data-driven approach, we conduct experiments that use two different task allocation mechanisms on the same set of scenarios, providing comparative performance data. We then train a classifier on this data, giving us a method for choosing the best mechanism for a given scenario. We show that selecting a mechanism via this method, compared to using a single state-of-the-art mechanism only, can improve team performance in certain environments, according to our metrics.},

    abstract = {CONSULT is a decision-support framework designed to help patients self-manage chronic conditions and adhere to agreed-upon treatment plans, in collaboration with healthcare professionals. The approach taken employs computational argumentation, a logic-based methodology that provides a formal means for reasoning with evidence by substantiating claims for and against particular conclusions. This paper outlines the architecture of CONSULT, illustrating how facts are gathered about the patient and various preferences of the patient and the clinician(s) involved. A logic-based representation of official treatment guidelines by various public health agencies is presented. Logical arguments are constructed from these facts and guidelines; these arguments are analysed to resolve inconsistencies concerning various treatment options and patient/clinician preferences. The claims of the justified arguments are the decisions recommended by CONSULT. A clinical example is presented which illustrates the use of CONSULT within the context of blood pressure management for secondary stroke prevention. },

Walton{\textquoteright}s contributions to argumentation theory have had a very strong influence on Artificial Intelligence (Ai), particularly in the design of autonomous software agents able to reason and argue with one another, and in the design of protocols to govern such interactions. In this paper, we explore two of these contributions — argumentation schemes and dialogue protocols — by discussing how they may be applied to a pressing current research challenge in Ai: the automated assessment of explanations for automated decision-making systems.},

    abstract = {Firewalls are an important tool in the assurance of network security. Packet filtering firewalls are configured by providing a set of rules that identify how to handle individual data packets that arrive at the firewall. In large firewall configurations, conflicts may arise between these rules. Argumentation provides a way of handling conflicts such that their origin is illuminated, and hence can help a system administrator understand the effects of a given configuration. To show how argumentation might help in this domain we examine the use of a system of metalevel argumentation for firewall configuration, showing how it makes conflicts and their origins clear, and showing how different instantiations of a metalevel argumentation system provide alternative ways to resolve conflicts.},
