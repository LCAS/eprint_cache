This suggests that principled investigations into optimal context windows are urgently needed given that the amount of dialogue history and corresponding representations can play an important role in the overall performance of a conversational system. This paper studies the amount of history required by conversational agents for reliably predicting dialogue rewards. The task of dialogue reward prediction is chosen for investigating the effects of varying amounts of dialogue history and their impact on system performance. Experimental results using a dataset of 18K human-human dialogues report that lengthy  dialogue histories of at least 10 sentences are preferred (25 sentences being the best in our experiments) over short ones, and that lengthy histories are useful for training dialogue reward predictors with strong positive correlations between target dialogue rewards and predicted ones.}

In addition, the angular velocity detecting model (AVDM) produces a response largely independent of the spatial frequency in grating experiments which enables insects to estimate the flight speed in cluttered environments. This also coincides with the behaviour experiments of honeybee flying through tunnels with stripes of different spatial frequencies.}

Duricrusts are thin, brittle layers of cemented regolith that cover the underlying terrain. In some cases, the duricrust hides safe or relatively safe underneath the top soil. However, as was observed by both Mars exploration rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, such crusts can also hide loose, untrafficable terrain, leading to Spirit becoming permanently incapacitated in 2009. Whilst several reports of the Martian surface have indicated the presence of duricrusts, none have been able to provide details on the physical properties of the material, which may indicate the level of safe traversability of duricrust terrains. This paper presents the findings of testing terrestrially-created duricrusts with simulated Martian soil properties, in order to determine the properties of such duricrusts and to discover what level of hazard that they may represent (e.g. can vehicles traverse the duricrust surface without penetration to lower sub-surface soils?). Combinations of elements that have been observed in the Martian soil were used as the basis for forming the laboratory-created duricrusts. Variations in duricrust thickness, water content, and the iron oxide compound were investigated. As was observed throughout the testing process, duricrusts behave in a rather brittle fashion and are easily destroyed by low surface pressures. This indicates that duricrusts are not safe for traversing and they present a definite hazard for travelling on the Martian landscape when utilising only visual terrain classification, as the surface appearance is not necessarily representative of what may be lying beneath.}

A case has been made for an active approach to fault tolerance in swarm robotic systems, whereby the swarm can identify and resolve faults that occur during operation. Existing approaches to active fault tolerance in swarms have so far omitted fault diagnosis, however we propose that diagnosis is a feature of active fault tolerance that is necessary if swarms are to obtain long-term autonomy. This paper presents a novel method for fault diagnosis that attempts to imitate some of the observed functions of natural immune system. The results of our simulated experiments show that our system is flexible, scalable, and improves swarm tolerance to various electro-mechanical faults in the cases examined.}

The contributions of underwater environment are taken into account by resorting to a recently introduced fundamental model of monopedal underwater hopping locomotion on which the tuning of a completely open loop control algorithm for dynamic gaits is based. The design of the robot and the control algorithm of each gait are presented along with experimental results which demonstrate on-spot static and dynamic rotation, and forward locomotion by crawling, walking and hopping. Moreover, for the first time the behavior of multi-legged underwater robots is grounded to the fundamental monopedal model. SILVER is the first underwater legged robot capable of performing dynamic self-stabilizing hopping gaits together with static gaits and precise foot placement. Thanks to its unique features the category of underwater legged robots has the potential to be a very versatile and valuable alternative to the existing technology for the exploration of the seabed.}

Where traditional methods for obstacle avoidance depend heavily on path planning to reach a specific goal location whilst avoiding obstacles, the method proposed uses an adaption of a potential fields algorithm to successfully avoid obstacles whilst the robot is being guided to a non-specific goal location. Details of a generalised finite state machine based control algorithm that enable the robot to pursue a dynamic goal location, whilst avoiding obstacles and without the need for specific path planning, are presented. We have developed a novel potential fields algorithm for obstacle avoidance for use within Robot Operating Software (ROS) and made it available for download within the open source community. We evaluated the control algorithm in a high-speed predator-prey scenario in which the predator could successfully catch the moving prey whilst avoiding collision with all obstacles within the environment.}

road users including pedestrians. Unlike passive environments,
pedestrians are active agents having their own utilities and
decisions, which must be inferred and predicted by AVs in order
to control interactions with them and navigation around them.
In particular, when a pedestrian wishes to cross the road in
front of the vehicle at an unmarked crossing, the pedestrian
and AV must compete for the space, which may be considered
as a game-theoretic interaction in which one agent must yield
to the other. To inform AV controllers in this setting, this study
collects and analyses data from real-world human road crossings
to determine what features of crossing behaviours are predictive
about the level of assertiveness of pedestrians and of the eventual
winner of the interactions. It presents the largest and most
detailed data set of its kind known to us, and new methods to
analyze and predict pedestrian-vehicle interactions based upon
it. Pedestrian-vehicle interactions are decomposed into sequences
of independent discrete events. We use probabilistic methods ?
regression and decision tree regression ? and sequence analysis
to analyze sets and sub-sequences of actions used by both
pedestrians and human drivers while crossing at an intersection,
to find common patterns of behaviour and to predict the winner
of each interaction. We report on the particular features found
to be predictive and which can thus be integrated into game-
theoretic AV controllers to inform real-time interactions.}

This paper presents a novel neuron model of a locust looming detector, i.e. the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD1), in order to provide effective solutions to enhance the collision selectivity of looming objects over other visual challenges. We propose an approach to model the biologically plausible mechanisms of ON and OFF pathways and a biophysical mechanism of spike frequency adaptation (SFA) in the proposed LGMD1 visual neural network. The ON and OFF pathways can separate both dark and light looming features for parallel spatiotemporal computations. This works effectively on perceiving a potential collision from dark or light objects that approach; such a bio-plausible structure can also separate LGMD1's collision selectivity to its neighbouring looming detector -- the LGMD2.The SFA mechanism can enhance the LGMD1's collision selectivity to approaching objects rather than receding and translating stimuli, which is a significant improvement compared with similar LGMD1 neuron models. The proposed framework has been tested using off-line tests of synthetic and real-world stimuli, as well as on-line bio-robotic tests. The enhanced collision selectivity of the proposed model has been validated in systematic experiments. The computational simplicity and robustness of this work have also been verified by the bio-robotic tests, which demonstrates potential in building neuromorphic sensors for collision detection in both a fast and reliable manner.}

Lidar data. Most existing semantic mapping approaches focus on improving semantic understanding of single frames, rather than 3D refinement of semantic maps (i.e. fusing semantic observations). The most widely-used approach for 3D semantic map refinement is a Bayes update, which fuses the consecutive predictive probabilities following a Markov-Chain model. Instead, we propose a learning approach to fuse the semantic features, rather than simply fusing predictions from a classifier. In our approach, we represent and maintain our 3D map as an OctoMap, and model each cell as a recurrent neural network (RNN), to obtain a Recurrent-OctoMap. In this case, the semantic mapping process can be formulated as a sequenceto-sequence encoding-decoding problem. Moreover, in order to extend the duration of observations in our Recurrent-OctoMap, we developed a robust 3D localization and mapping system for successively mapping a dynamic environment using more than two weeks of data, and the system can be trained and deployed with arbitrary memory length. We validate our approach on the ETH long-term 3D Lidar dataset [1]. The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms the conventional ?Bayes update? approach.}

In this paper we extend the NDT registration pipeline by using PointNet, a deep neural network for segmentation and classification of point clouds, to learn and predict per-point semantic labels. We also present the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) equivalent of the algorithm, a special case of Multichannel Generalized ICP. We evaluate the performance of SE-NDT against the state of the art in point cloud registration on the publicly available classification data set Semantic3d.net. We also test the trained classifier and algorithms on dynamic scenes, using a sequence from the public dataset KITTI. The experiments demonstrate the improvement of the registration in terms of robustness, precision and speed, across a range of initial registration errors, thanks to the inclusion of semantic information.}

        abstract = {In this study, an analysis of the performance of a twin-shaft industrial gas turbine (IGT) with a fault in the mechanism of the compressor that changes the position of variable stator guide vanes (VSGVs) is carried out. Measured field data of a twin-shaft engine denoting a difference (offset) between the demanded inlet guide vane (IGV) angle and the measured IGV angle in the axial compressor have been considered for the analysis. A validated Simulink model which simulates the performance of the twin-shaft engine has been considered for the analysis of the fault in the VSGV system. The Simulink model architecture comprises an axial compressor module and considers an multi-stage compressor performance map at optimal conditions (new \& clean). The results demonstrate that it is possible to predict the physical parameters such as pressure and temperature measured across the different stations of the engine during the offset of the IGV angle. The effect of the IGV offset on the compressor performance is discussed as well. The change in compressor air flow and compressor efficiency at different IGV offset is discussed, as during a low power engine operation and fault within the VSGV system, the surge line may drift close to the compressor running operation line.}

In this paper, we focus on pixel-based approaches for classification of crops versus weeds, especially for complex cases involving overlapping plants and partial occlusion. We examine the benefits of multi-scale and content-driven morphology-based descriptors called Attribute Profiles. These are compared to state-of-the art keypoint descriptors with a fixed neighbourhood previously used in precision agriculture, namely Histograms of Oriented Gradients and Local Binary Patterns. The proposed classification technique is especially advantageous when coupled with morphology-based segmentation on a max-tree structure, as the same representation can be re-used for feature extraction. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated by an experimental evaluation on two datasets with different crop types. The proposed approach compared favourably to state-of-the-art approaches without an increase in computational complexity, while being able to provide descriptors at a higher resolution.}

        abstract = {Keeping a human in a robot learning cycle can provide many advantages to improve the learning process. However, most of these improvements are only available when the human teacher is in complete control of the robot?s behaviour, and not just providing feedback. This human control can make the learning process safer, allowing the robot to learn in high-stakes interaction scenarios especially social ones. Furthermore, it allows faster learning as the human guides the robot to the relevant parts of the state space and can provide additional information to the learner. This information can also enable the
learning algorithms to learn for wider world representations, thus increasing the generalisability of a deployed system. Additionally, learning from end users improves the precision of the final policy as it can be specifically tailored to many situations. Finally, this progressive teaching might create trust between the learner and the teacher, easing the deployment of the autonomous robot. However, with such control comes a range of challenges. Firstly, the rich communication between the robot and the teacher needs to be handled by an interface, which may require complex features. Secondly, the teacher needs to be embedded within the robot action selection cycle, imposing time constraints, which increases the cognitive load on the teacher. Finally, given a cycle of interaction between the robot and the teacher, any mistakes made by the teacher can be propagated to the robot?s policy. Nevertheless, we are are able to show that empowering the teacher with ways to control a robot?s behaviour has the potential to drastically improve both the learning process (allowing robots to learn in a wider range of environments) and the experience of the teacher.}

In this paper, we introduce a framework allowing a robot to learn a new 3D LiDAR-based human classifier from other sensors over time, taking advantage of a multisensor tracking system. The main innovation is the use of different detectors for existing sensors (i.e. RGB-D camera, 2D LiDAR) to train, online, a new 3D LiDAR-based human classifier based on a new ?trajectory probability?. Our framework uses this probability to check whether new detections belongs to a human trajectory, estimated by different sensors and/or detectors, and to learn a human classifier in a semi-supervised fashion. The framework has been implemented and tested on a real-world dataset collected by a mobile robot. We present experiments illustrating that our system is able to effectively learn from different sensors and from the environment, and that the performance of the 3D LiDAR-based human classification improves with the number of sensors/detectors used.}

        abstract = {The growing and uncontrollable stream of refugees from Middle East and North Africa has created considerable pressure to governments and societies all over Europe. To establish the theoretical framework, the concept of humanitarian logistics is briefly examined in this paper. Historical data from the nineteenth century onwards illuminates the fact that this influx is not a novelty in the European continent and the interpretation of statistical data highlights the characteristics and particularities of the current refugee wave, as well as the possible repercussions these could inflict both to hosting societies and to displaced populations. Finally, a review of European and national legislation and policies shows that measures taken so far are disjointed and that no complete but at the same time fair and humanitarian management strategy exists.

Within this context, the paper elaborates on the development of a compact accommodation center made of shipping containers, to function as one of the initial stages in adaptation before full social integration of the displaced populations. It aims at maximizing the respect for human rights and values while minimizing the impact on society and on the environment. Some of the humanitarian and ecological issues discussed are: integration of medical, educational, religious and social functions within the unit, optimal land utilization, renewable energy use, and waste management infrastructures. Creating added value for the ?raw? material (shipping containers) and prolonging the unit?s life span by enabling transformation and change of use, transportation and reuse, and finally end-of-life dismantlement and recycling also lie within the scope of the project.

The overall goal is not only to address the current needs stemming from the refugee crisis, but also to develop a project versatile enough to be adapted for implementation on further social groups in need of support. The paper?s results could serve as a useful tool for governments and organizations to better plan ahead and respond fast and efficiently not only in regard to the present humanitarian emergency, but also in any possible similar major disaster situation, including the potential consequences of climate change.}

A class of specific neurons, called small target motion detectors (STMDs), has been characterized by exquisite sensitivity for small target motion. Understanding and analyzing visual pathway of STMD neurons are beneficial to design artificial visual systems for small target motion detection. Feedback loops have been widely identified in visual neural circuits and play an important role in target detection. However, if there exists a feedback loop in the STMD visual pathway or if a feedback loop could significantly improve the detection performance of STMD neurons, is unclear. In this paper, we propose a feedback neural network for small target motion detection against naturally cluttered backgrounds. In order to form a feedback loop, model output is temporally delayed and relayed to previous neural layer as feedback signal. Extensive experiments showed that the significant improvement of the proposed feedback neural network over the existing STMD-based models for small target motion detection.}

Unlike the existing architecture that fuses score maps from different modalities with equal weights, we propose a softmax weighted fusion stack that adaptively learns the varying contributions of PixelNet and VoxelNet and fuses the score maps according to their respective confidence levels. Our approach achieved competitive results on both the SUN RGB-D and NYU V2 benchmarks, while the runtime of the proposed system is boosted to around 13 Hz, enabling near-real-time performance using an i7 eight-cores PC with a single Titan X GPU.}

Prior work considered including the human in the loop to jointly learn the reward function and the optimal policy. Generating samples from a physical robot and requesting human feedback are both taxing efforts for which efficiency is critical. In contrast to prior work, in this paper we propose to learn reward functions from both the robot and the human perspectives in order to improve on both efficiency metrics. On one side, learning a reward function from the human perspective increases feedback efficiency by assuming that humans rank trajectories according to an outcome space of reduced dimensionaltiy. On the other side, learning a reward function from the robot perspective circumvents the need for learning a dynamics model while retaining the sample efficiency of model-based approaches. We provide an algorithm that incorporates bi-perspective reward learning into a general hierarchical reinforcement learning framework and demonstrate the merits of our approach on a toy task and a simulated robot grasping task.}

robots. While most previously reported methods are based on learning of 2D positions in monocular camera images,
our approach uses range-finder sensors to learn and predict 3DOF pose trajectories (i.e. 2D position plus 1D rotation within the world coordinate system). Our approach, T-Pose-LSTM (Temporal 3DOF-Pose Long-Short-Term Memory), is trained using long-term data from real-world robot deployments and aims to learn context-dependent (environment- and time-specific) human activities. Our approach incorporates long-term temporal information (i.e. date and time) with short-term pose observations as input. A sequence-to-sequence LSTM encoder-decoder is trained, which encodes observations into LSTM and then decodes the resulting predictions. On deployment, the approach can perform on-the-fly prediction in real-time. Instead of using manually annotated data, we rely on a robust human detection, tracking and SLAM system, providing us with examples in a global coordinate system. We validate the approach using more than 15 km of pedestrian trajectories recorded in a care home environment over a period of three months. The experiments show that the proposed T-PoseLSTM model outperforms the state-of-the-art 2D-based method for human trajectory prediction in long-term mobile robot deployments.}

We train a Gaussian process (GP) regression model to continuously regulate the level of assistance between the user and the robot, given the user's previous and current actions and the state of the environment. The assistance policy is learned after only a single human demonstration, i.e. in one-shot. Our technique is evaluated in a one-of-a-kind experimental study, where the machine-learned shared control policy is compared to human assistance. Our analyses show that our technique is successful in emulating human shared control, by matching the location and amount of offered assistance on different trajectories. We observed that the effort requirement of the users were comparable between human-robot and human-human settings. Under the learned policy, the jerkiness of the user's joystick movements dropped significantly, despite a significant increase in the jerkiness of the robot assistant's commands. In terms of performance, even though the robotic assistance increased task completion time, the average distance to obstacles stayed in similar ranges to human assistance.}

Prior work on grasping often assumes that a sufficient amount of training data is available for learning and planning robotic grasps. However, since constructing such an exhaustive training dataset is very challenging in practice, it is desirable that a robotic system can autonomously learn and improves its grasping strategy. In this paper, we address this problem using reinforcement learning. Although recent work has presented autonomous data collection through trial and error, such methods are often limited to a single grasp type, e.g., vertical pinch grasp. We present a hierarchical policy search approach for learning multiple grasping strategies. Our framework autonomously constructs a database of grasping motions and point clouds of objects to learn multiple grasping types autonomously. We formulate the problem of selecting the grasp location and grasp policy as a bandit problem, which can be interpreted as a variant of active learning. We applied our reinforcement learning to grasping both rigid and deformable objects. The experimental results show that our framework autonomously learns and improves its performance through trial and error and can grasp previously unseen objects with a high accuracy.}

Low stiffness at the tip is much preferred for safe navigation of the robot in restricted spaces inside the human body. On the other hand, high stiffness at the tip is demanded for efficiently operating surgical instruments. In this paper, the manipulability and characteristics of a class of soft hyper-redundant manipulator, fabricated using Ecoflex-0050TM silicone, is discussed and a new methodology is introduced to actively tune the stiffness matrix, in real-time, for disturbance rejection and stiffness control. Experimental results are used to derive a more accurate description of the characteristics of the soft manipulator, capture the varying stiffness effects of the actuated arm and consequently offer a more accurate response using closed loop feedback control in real-time. The novel results presented in this paper advances the state-of-the-art of tunable stiffness control in soft continuum manipulators for real-time applications.}

        abstract = {Handling delicate crops without damaging or bruising is a challenge facing the au-tomation of tasks within the agri-food sector, which encourages the utilization of soft grippers that are inherently safe and passively compliant. In this paper we present a brief overview of the development of a printable soft gripper integrated with printable bend sensors. The softness of the gripper fingers allows delicate crops to be grasped gently, while the bend sensors are calibrated to measure bending and detect contact. This way the soft gripper not only benefits from the passive compliance of its soft fingers, but also demonstrates a sensor-guided approach for improved grasp control.}

We present an analysis of failure and recovery cases derived from long-term autonomous operation of a mobile robot, and propose a two-layer learning framework that allows to detect and recover from such navigation failures. Employing a learning by demonstration (LbD) approach, our framework can incrementally learn to autonomously recover from situations it initially needs humans to help with. The learning framework allows for both real-time failure detection and regression using Gaussian processes (GPs). Our empirical results on two different failure scenarios indicate that given 40 failure state observations, the true positive rate of the failure detection model exceeds 90\%, ending with successful recovery actions in more than 90\% of all detected cases.}

This process is traditionally undertaken using reverse correlation to estimate the receptive field. By stimulating the retina with artificial stimuli, such as alternating checkerboards, bars or gratings and recording the neural response it is possible to estimate the cell?s receptive field by analysing the stimuli that produced the response. Artificial stimuli such as white noise is known to not stimulate the full range of the cell?s responses. By using natural image stimuli, it is possible to estimate the receptive field and obtain a resulting model that more accurately mimics the cells? responses to natural stimuli. This paper extends on previous work to seek further improvements in estimating a ganglion cell?s receptive field by considering that the receptive field can be divided into subunits. It is thought that these subunits may relate to receptive fields which are associated with bipolar retinal cells. The findings of this preliminary study show that by using subunits to define the receptive field we achieve a significant improvement over existing approaches when deriving computational models of the cell?s response.}

Effective soil mapping on farms can enhance yields, reduce inputs and help protect the environment. Traditionally, data are collected manually at an arbitrary set of locations, then soil maps are constructed offline using kriging, a form of Gaussian process regression. This process is laborious and costly, limiting the quality and resolution of the resulting information. 
Instead, we propose to use an outdoor mobile robot for automatic collection of soil condition data, building soil maps online and also adapting the robot's exploration strategy on-the-fly based on the current quality of the map. We show how using kriging variance as a reward function for robotic exploration allows for both more efficient data collection and better soil models. This work presents the theoretical foundations for our proposal and an experimental comparison of exploration strategies using soil compaction data from a field generated with a mobile robot.}

Recently, it has been proposed that animals may combine cues optimally using a ring attractor neural network architecture inspired by the head direction system of rats augmented with a dynamic re-weighting mechanism. In this work we report that an older and simpler ring attractor network architecture, requiring no re-weighting property combines cues according to their certainty for moderate cue conflicts but converges on the most certain cue for larger conflicts. These results are consistent with observations in animal experiments that show sub-optimal cue integration and switching from cue integration to cue selection strategies. This work therefore demonstrates an alternative architecture for those seeking neural correlates of sensory integration in animals. In addition, performance is shown robust to noise and miniaturization and thus provides an efficient solution for artificial systems.}

Different  perspectives and  research  problems,  such  as  energy  efficiency,  security  and threats, to name but a few, have been dealt with and addressed from cloud computing perspective. However, cloud computing environment still encounters a major challenge of how to allocate and  manage  computational  resources  efficiently.  Furthermore, due to the different architectures and cloud computing networks and models used (i.e., federated clouds, VM migrations, cloud brokerage), the complexity of resource management in the cloud has been increased dramatically. Cloud providers and service consumers have the cloud brokers working as the intermediaries between them, and the confusion among the cloud computing parties (consumers, brokers, data centres and service providers) on who is responsible for managing the request of cloud resources is a key issue. In a traditional scenario, upon renting the various cloud resources from the providers, the cloud brokers engage in subletting and managing these resources to the service consumers. However, providers? usually deal with many brokers, and vice versa, and any dispute of any kind between the providers and the brokers will lead to service unavailability, in which  the  consumer  is  the  only  victim.  Therefore,  managing  cloud resources and services still needs a lot of attention and effort. This paper expresses the survey on the systems of the cloud brokerage resource management issues in multi-cloud environments.}

As a focal point of sustainability initiatives, green supply chain management has emerged as a key strategy that can provide competitive advantages with significant parallel gains for company profitability. In designing a green supply chain, the intent is the adoption of comprehensive and cross-business sustainability principles, from the product conception stage to the end-of-life stage. In this context, green initiatives relate to tangible and intangible corporate benefits. Sustainability reports from numerous companies reveal that greening their supply chains has helped reduce operating cost, thus boosting effectiveness and efficiency while increasing sustainability of the business.

Green Supply Chain Management provides a strategic overview of sustainable supply chain management, shedding light on the theoretical background and key principles of the topic. Specifically, this book covers various thematic areas including benefits and impact of green supply chain management; enablers and barriers on supply chain operations; inbound and outbound logistics considerations; and production, packaging and reverse logistics under the notion of "greening". The ultimate aim of this textbook is to highlight the challenges in the implementation of green supply chain management in modern companies and to provide a roadmap for decision-making in real-life cases.

Combining chapter summaries and discussion questions, this book provides an accessible and student-friendly introduction to green supply change management and will be of great interest to students, scholars and practitioners in the fields of sustainable business and supply chain management.}

In this paper, we propose a novel image processing pipeline based on attribute morphology for both the segmentation and classification tasks. The commonly used approaches for vegetation segmentation often rely on thresholding techniques which reach their decisions globally. By contrast, the proposed method works with connected components obtained by image threshold decomposition, which are naturally nested in a hierarchical structure called the max-tree, and various attributes calculated from these regions. Image segmentation is performed by attribute filtering, preserving or discarding the regions based on their attribute value and allowing for the decision to be reached locally. This segmentation method naturally selects a collection of foreground regions rather than pixels, and the same data structure used for segmentation can be further reused to provide the features for classification, which is realised in our experiments by a support vector machine (SVM). We apply our methods to normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) images, and demonstrate the performance of the pipeline on a dataset collected by the authors in an onion field, as well as a publicly available dataset for sugar beets. The results show that the proposed segmentation approach can segment the fine details of plant regions locally, in contrast to the state-of-the-art thresholding methods, while providing discriminative features which enable efficient and competitive classification rates for crop/weed discrimination.}

Subsequently, the principalcomponent analysis was used to reduce the redundancy of the constructed features, andthe first 5 principal components, explaining over 95\% variance ratio, were kept for furtheranalysis. Furthermore, random forests as one of machine learning techniques were builtfor developing the classifier with three different combinations of features.

Conventional vision CNNs are driven by camera frames at constant sample rate, thus achieving a fixed latency and power consumption tradeoff. This paper describes further work on the first experiments of a closed-loop robotic system integrating a CNN together with a Dynamic and Active Pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) in a predator/prey scenario. The DAVIS, mounted on the predator Summit XL robot, produces frames at a fixed 15 Hz frame-rate and Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) histograms containing 5k ON and OFF events at a variable frame-rate ranging from 15-500 Hz depending on the robot speeds. In contrast to conventional frame-based systems, the latency and processing cost depends on the rate of change of the image. The CNN is trained offline on the 1.25h labeled dataset to recognize the position and size of the prey robot, in the field of view of the predator. During inference, combining the ten output classes of the CNN allows extracting the analog position vector of the prey relative to the predator with a mean 8.7\% error in angular estimation. The system is compatible with conventional deep learning technology, but achieves a variable latency-power tradeoff that adapts automatically to the dynamics. Finally, investigations on the robustness of the algorithm, a human performance comparison and a deconvolution analysis are also explored.}

        abstract = {As we are within the era of the internet of things (IoT) its increasing integration to our everyday lives means that the devices involved produce massive amounts of data every second from billions of devices. The current approach used to handle this data is cloud computing. However because of its requirement of data centres this can become infeasible for the processing of data from IoT due to distance between these IoT smart objects (e.g., sensors) and the data centre. If this data holds any importance to minimal delay then the travel time between the end device and the clouds data centre could affect the relevance of that data. Therefore, to deal with these issues a new network paradigm placed closer to the IoT end devices is introduced called "Fog computing" to help address these challenges. If introduced effectively then fog computing can lead to the improvements in the quality of service (QoS) offered to systems that require the processing of delay sensitive data like healthcare systems that could benefit from the quick processing of data from sensors to allow the monitoring of patients. This paper has a main focus on healthcare systems. An architecture containing three layers; things (i.e., sensors), fog nodes and a cloud data centre is proposed alongside a framework incorporating this architecture. This framework offers collaboration among fog nodes with optimal management of resources and job allocation, which is able to achieve a high QoS (i.e., low latency) within the scenario of a healthcare system.}

        abstract = {. Previous work (Binch \& Fox, 2017) used autonomous ground robotic platforms to successfully detect Urtica (nettle) and Rumex (dock) weeds in grassland, to improve farm productivity and the environment through precision herbicide spraying. It assumed that ground robots swathe entire fields to both detect and spray weeds, but this is a slow process as the slow ground platform must drive over every square meter of the field even where there are no weeds. The present study examines a complimentary approach, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform faster detections, in order to inform slower ground robots of weed location and direct them to spray them from the ground. In a controlled study, it finds that the existing state-of-the-art (Binch \& Fox, 2017) ground detection algorithm based on local binary patterns and support vector machines is easily re-usable from a UAV with 4K camera despite large differences in camera type, distance, perspective and motion, without retraining. The algorithm achieves 83-95\% accuracy on ground platform data with 1-3 independent views, and improves to 90\% from single views on aerial data. However this is only attainable at low altitudes up to 8 feet, speeds below 0.3m/s, and a vertical view angle, suggesting that autonomous or manual UAV swathing is required to cover fields, rather than use of a single high-altitude photograph. This demonstrates for the first time that combined aerial detection with ground spraying system is feasible for Rumex and Urtica in grassland, using UAVs to replace the swathing and detection of weeds then dispatching ground platforms to spray them at the detection sites (as spraying by UAV is illegal in EU countries). This reduces total time requires to spray as the UAV performs the survey stage faster than a ground platform.}

One of the possible solution to this is combining more than one locomotion mechanisms in the robot. In this paper, robotic platform composed of a quadruped module for terrain locomotion and quadrotor module for aerial locomotion is introduced. This design is inspired by the way which birds are using their wings and legs for stability in slopped and uneven surfaces. The main idea is to combine the two systems in such a way that the strengths of both subsystems are used, and the weakness of the either systems are covered. The ability of the robot to reach the target position quickly and to avoid large terrestrial obstacles by flying expands its application in various areas of search and rescue. The same platform can be used for detailed 3D mapping and aerial mapping which are very helpful in rescue operations. In particular, this paper presents kinematic design, analysis and simulation of such a robotic system. Simulation and verification of results are done using MATLAB.}

Hybrid locomotion improves the maneuverability and flexibility of a robot. This paper introduces a hybrid locomotion mobile robot, a combination of quadruped and quadrotor system. The robot has a unique expediency to fly to remote places, then walk to perform close range operations in the field. The prime intention is to use the quadrotor to tackle large objects by flying over it. The four legs provide easy movements in uneven terrain. Thus, this robot can be used in erratic and dynamic environments where stability, maneuverability and flexibility are required. This system can be used as first responders in search and rescue missions, where it responds before human responders gets to the site and get the entire information of the area in detail (like spotting trapped ones, getting detailed 3D mapping etc.). This platform offers unique capabilities suited for search and rescue, disaster zone assistance and surveillances. This paper elucidates the mechanical design and analysis of a hybrid locomotion robot. The solid model of the robot was made using CATIA and further analysis like static analysis, computational fluid dynamics analysis and drop test analysis were performed in ANSYS.}

vehicles (AVs). When a pedestrian wishes to cross the road in front of the
vehicle at an unmarked crossing, the pedestrian and AV must compete
for the space, which may be considered as a game-theoretic interaction in
which one agent must yield to the other. To inform development of new
real-time AV controllers in this setting, this study collects and analy-
ses detailed, manually-annotated, temporal data from real-world human
road crossings as they interact with manual drive vehicles. It studies the
temporal orderings (filtrations) in which features are revealed to the ve-
hicle and their informativeness over time. It presents a new framework
suggesting how optimal stopping controllers may then use such data to
enable an AV to decide when to act (by speeding up, slowing down, or
otherwise signalling intent to the pedestrian) or alternatively, to continue
at its current speed in order to gather additional information from new
features, including signals from that pedestrian, before acting itself.}

the need for robots to be able to manipulate objects, not only independently, but also

actions with fellow humans encompasses several behaviours that are collectively referred
to as joint action, and has inspired advances in human-robot interaction by leveraging
our natural ability to interpret implicit cues. However, our capacity to efficiently coordinate
on object manipulation tasks remains an advantageous process that is yet to be fully
exploited in robotic applications. Humans achieve this form of coordination by combining
implicit communication (where information is inferred) and explicit communication (direct
communication through an established channel) in varying degrees according to the task
at hand. Although these two forms of communication have previously been implemented
in robotic systems, no system exists that integrates the two in a task-dependent adaptive
manner. In this paper, we review existing work on joint action in human-robot interaction,
and analyse the state-of-the-art in robot-robot interaction that could act as a foundation
for future cooperative object manipulation approaches. We identify key mechanisms that

We are presenting a newly launched robotics initiative which will help to address the issues faced by the industry and enable automation of the main processes involved in soft fruit production.

To achieve this goal, the project will bridge several current technological gaps including the development of a mobile platform suitable for the strawberry fields, software components for fleet management, in-field navigation and mapping, long-term operation, and safe human-robot collaboration.
In this paper, we provide a general overview of the project, describe the main system components, highlight interesting challenges from a control point of view and then present three specific applications of the robotic fleets in soft fruit production. The applications demonstrate how robotic fleets can benefit the soft fruit industry by significantly decreasing production costs, addressing labour shortages and being the first step towards fully autonomous robotic systems for agriculture.}

There is a strong tradition of inter-disciplinarity in the study of visual perception and visual cognition. Many of the great natural scientists including Newton [1], Young [2] and Maxwell (see [3]) were intrigued by the relationship between light, surfaces and perceived colour considering both physical and perceptual processes. Brewster [4] invented both the lenticular stereoscope and the binocular camera but also studied the perception of shape-from-shading. More recently, Marr's [5] description of visual perception as an information processing problem led to great advances in our understanding of both biological and computer vision: both the computer vision and biological vision communities have a Marr medal. The recent successes of deep neural networks in classifying the images that we see and the fMRI images that reveal the activity in our brains during the act of seeing are both intriguing. The links between machine vision systems and biology may at sometimes be weak but the similarity of some of the operations is nonetheless striking [6]. This two-day meeting brought together researchers from the fields of biological and computer vision, robotics, neuroscience, computer science and psychology to discuss the most recent developments in the field. The meeting was divided into four themes: vision for action, visual appearance, vision for recognition and machine learning.}

In this study, we developed a strategy for inter- and intra-row weed detection in early season maize fields from aerial visual imagery. More specifically, the Hough transform algorithm (HT) was applied to the orthomosaicked images for inter-row weed detection. A semi-automatic Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) procedure was developed with Random Forests (RF) combined with feature selection techniques to classify soil, weeds and maize. Furthermore, the two binary weed masks generated from HT and OBIA were fused for accurate binary weed image. The developed RF classifier was evaluated by 5-fold cross validation, and it obtained an overall accuracy of 0.945, and Kappa value of 0.912. Finally, the relationship of detected weeds and their ground truth densities was quantified by a fitted linear model with a coefficient of determination of 0.895 and a root mean square error of 0.026. Besides, the importance of input features was evaluated, and it was found that the ratio of vegetation length and width was the most significant feature for the classification model. Overall, our approach can yield a satisfactory weed map, and we expect that the obtained accurate and timely weed map from UAV imagery will be applicable to realize site-specific weed management (SSWM) in early season crop fields for reducing spraying non-selective herbicides and costs.}

The robot is building soil models on-line using standard geo-statistical methods such as kriging, and is using the quality of the model to drive the exploration. In this work, we take a closer look at the kriging process itself and how its parameters affect the exploration outcome. For this purpose, we employ soil compaction datasets collected from two real fields of varying characteristics and analyse how the parameters vary between fields and how they change during the exploration process. We particularly focus on the stability of the kriging parameters, their evolution over the exploration process and influence on the resulting soil maps.}

Such tasks have been solved successfully with robot swarms that are controlled by a human operator using a light source.
In this paper, we present a method to solve such assembly tasks autonomously based on policy search methods. We split the assembly process in two subtasks: generating a high-level assembly plan and learning a low-level object movement policy.  The assembly policy plans the trajectories for each object and the object movement policy controls the trajectory execution.  Learning the object movement policy is challenging as it depends on the complex state of the swarm which consists of an individual state for each agent. To approach this problem, we introduce a representation of the swarm which is based on Hilbert space embeddings of distributions. This representation is invariant to the number of agents in the swarm as well as to the allocation of an agent to its position in the swarm.  These invariances make the learned policy robust to changes in the swarm and also reduce the search space for the policy search method significantly. We show that the resulting system is able to solve assembly tasks with varying object shapes in multiple simulation scenarios and evaluate the robustness of our representation to changes in the swarm size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the policies learned in simulation are robust enough to be transferred to real robots.}

One particular interesting application with robot swarms is autonomous object assembly. Such tasks have been solved successfully with robot swarms that are controlled by a human operator using a light source. In this paper, we present a method to solve such assembly tasks autonomously based on policy search methods. We split the assembly process in two subtasks: generating a high-level assembly plan and learning a low-level object movement policy. The assembly policy plans the trajectories for each object and the object movement policy controls the trajectory execution.
Learning the object movement policy is challenging as it depends on the complex state of the swarm which consists of an individual state for each agent. To approach this problem, we introduce a representation of the swarm which is based on Hilbert space embeddings of distributions. This representation is invariant to the number of agents in the swarm as well as to the allocation of an agent to its position in the swarm.  These invariances make the learned policy robust to changes in the swarm and also reduce the search space for the policy search method significantly. We show that the resulting system is able to solve assembly tasks with varying object shapes in multiple simulation scenarios and evaluate the robustness of our representation to changes in the swarm size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the policies learned in simulation are robust enough to be transferred to real robots.}

        abstract = {Challenging tasks in unstructured environments require robots to learn complex models. Given a large amount of information, learning multiple simple models can offer an efficient alternative to a monolithic complex network. Training multiple models{--}that is, learning their parameters and their responsibilities{--}has been shown to be prohibitively hard as optimization is prone to local minima. To efficiently learn multiple models for different contexts, we thus develop a new algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM). In contrast to comparable concepts, this algorithm trains multiple modules of paired forward-inverse models by using the prediction errors of both forward and inverse models simultaneously.  In particular, we show that our method yields a substantial improvement over only considering the errors of the forward models on tasks where the inverse space contains multiple solutions}

Current artificial vision techniques integrate many insights from biology yet they remain far-off the capabilities of animals and humans in terms of speed, power, and performance. A key aspect to modeling the human visual system is the ability to accurately model the behavior and computation within the retina. In particular, we focus on modeling the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) as they convey the accumulated data of real world images as action potentials onto the visual cortex via the optic nerve. Computational models that approximate the processing that occurs within RGCs can be derived by quantitatively fitting the sets of physiological data using an input?output analysis where the input is a known stimulus and the output is neuronal recordings. Currently, these input?output responses are modeled using computational combinations of linear and nonlinear models that are generally complex and lack any relevance to the underlying biophysics. In this paper, we illustrate how system identification techniques, which take inspiration from biological systems, can accurately model retinal ganglion cell behavior, and are a viable alternative to traditional linear?nonlinear approaches.}

In particular, the simulation model of a typical refrigeration system with a single pack of 6 compressor units operating as fixed volume displacement machines is presented, and the potential of delivering static FFR with a large population of such packs is studied. Tuning of the model is performed using experimental data collected at the Refrigeration Research Centre in Riseholme, Lincoln. The purpose of modelling is to monitor the essential dynamics of what resembles a typical supermarket convenience-type store and to measure the capacity of a massive refrigeration network to hold off a considerable amount of load in response to FFR DSR event. This study focuses on investigation of the aggregated response of 150 packs (approx. 1 MW capacity) with refrigeration cases on hysteresis and modulation control. The presented model captures interconnected dynamics (refrigerant flow in the system linked to temperature control and the system's refrigerant demand and to compressors' power consumption). Type of refrigerant used for simulation is R407F. Refrigerant properties such as specific enthalpy, pressure and temperature at different state points are computed on each time step of simulation with REFPROP.}

Underlying this capability, ventral stream plays an important role in object representation and form recognition. Modeling the ventral steam may shed light on further understanding the visual brain in humans and building artificial vision systems for pattern recognition. The current methods to model the mechanism of ventral stream are far from exhibiting fast, continuous and event-driven learning like the human brain. To create a visual system similar to ventral stream in human with fast learning capability, in this study, we propose a new spiking neural system with an event-driven continuous spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning method using specific spiking timing sequences. Two novel continuous input mechanisms have been used to obtain the continuous input spiking pattern sequence. With the event-driven STDP learning rule, the proposed learning procedure will be activated if the neuron receive one pre- or post-synaptic spike event. The experimental results on MNIST database show that the proposed method outperforms all other methods in fast learning scenarios and most of the current models in exhaustive learning experiments.}

Although EMD and TQD can percept background motion, their outputs are so cluttered that it is difficult to discriminate actual motion direction of the background. In this paper, we propose a max operation mechanism to model a newly-found transmedullary neuron Tm9 whose physiological properties do not map onto EMD and TQD. This proposed max operation mechanism is able to improve the detection performance of TQD in cluttered background by filtering out irrelevant motion signals. We will demonstrate the functionality of this proposed mechanism in wide-field motion perception.}

An experimental setup was constructed to test the SPA at different input pressure values and orientations, while recording the resulting feedback from the embedded flex sensor and on-board pressure sensor. A calibrated high speed camera captures image frames during the actuation, which are then analysed using an image processing program to calculate the actual bending angle and synchronise it with the recorded sensory feedback. Empirical models were derived based on the generated experimental data using two common data-driven modelling techniques; regression analysis and artificial neural networks. Both techniques were validated using a new dataset at untrained operating conditions to evaluate their prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the derived empirical model was used as part of a closed-loop PID controller to estimate and control the bending angle of the tested SPA based on the real-time sensory feedback generated. The tuned PID controller allowed the bending SPA to accurately follow stepped and sinusoidal reference signals, even in the presence of pressure leaks in the pneumatic supply. This work demonstrates how purely data-driven models can be effectively used in controlling the bending of SPAs under different operating conditions, avoiding the need for complex analytical modelling and material characterisation. Ultimately, the aim is to create more controllable soft grippers based on such SPAs with embedded sensing capabilities, to be used in applications requiring both a ?soft touch? as well as a more controllable object manipulation.}

In such work, a crucial role is played by the notion of attack between arguments, and the notion of attack is well-studied. There is, for example, a range of different approaches to identifying which of a set of arguments should be accepted given the attacks between them. Less well studied is the notion of support between arguments, yet the idea that one argument may support another is very intuitive and seems particularly relevant in the area of decision-making where decision options may have multiple arguments for and against them. In the last decade, the study of support in argumentation has regained attention among researchers, but most approaches address support in the context of abstract argumentation where the elements from which arguments are composed are ignored. In contrast, this paper studies the notion of support between arguments in the context of structured argumentation systems where the elements from which arguments are composed play a crucial role. Different forms of support are presented, each of which takes into account the structure of arguments; and the relationships between these forms of support are studied. Then, the paper investigates whether there is a correspondence between the structured and abstract forms of support, and determines whether the abstract formalisms may be instantiated using concrete forms of support in terms of structured arguments. The conclusion is that support in structured argumentation does not mesh well with support in abstract argumentation, and this suggests that more work is required to develop forms of support in abstract argumentation that model what happens in structured argumentation.}

RLfD mostly has been successfully exploited only in non-varying environments to reduce the programming time and cost, e.g. fixed manufacturing workspaces. Non-conventional production lines necessitate Human?Robot Collaboration (HRC) implying robots and humans must work in shared workspaces. In such conditions, the robot needs to avoid colliding with the objects that are moved by humans in the workspace. Therefore, not only is the robot: (i) required to learn a task model from demonstrations; but also, (ii) must learn a control policy to avoid a stationary obstacle. Furthermore, (iii) it needs to build a control policy from demonstration to avoid moving obstacles. Here, we present an incremental approach to RLfD addressing all these three problems.

We call an antibody of population quantum bit encoding, in QICA-CARP. For this encoding, to control the population with a high probability evolution towards a good schema we use the information on the current optimal antibody. The mutation strategy of quantum rotation gate accelerates the convergence of the original clone operator. Moreover, quantum crossover operator enhances the exchange of information and increases the diversity of the population. Furthermore, it avoids falling into local optimum. We also use the repair operator to amend the infeasible solutions to ensure the diversity of solutions. This makes QICA-CARP approximating the optimal solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by a set of experiments and by Comparing the results of our approach with ones obtained with the RDG-MAENS and RAM using different test sets. Experimental results show that QICA-CARP outperforms other algorithms in terms of convergence rate and the quality of the obtained solutions. Especially, QICA-CARP converges to a better lower bound at a faster rate illustrating that it is suitable for solving large-scale CARP.}

However, while many MP frameworks exhibit some of these properties, there is a need for a unified framework that implements all of them in a principled way. In this paper, we show that this goal can be achieved by using a probabilistic representation. Our approach models trajectory distributions learned from stochastic movements. Probabilistic operations, such as conditioning can be used to achieve generalization to novel situations or to combine and blend movements in a principled way. We derive a stochastic feedback controller that reproduces the encoded variability of the
movement and the coupling of the degrees of freedom of the robot. We evaluate and compare our approach on several simulated and real robot scenarios.}

An easy-to-implement PneuEA gripper is proposed by the integration of an electroadhesive gripper and a two-fingered soft pneumatic gripper. The electroadhesive gripper was fabricated by segmenting a soft conductive silicon sheet into a two-part electrode design and embedding it in a soft dielectric elastomer. The two-fingered soft pneumatic gripper was manufactured using a standard soft lithography approach. This novel integration has combined the benefits of both the electroadhesive and soft pneumatic grippers. As a result, the proposed PneuEA gripper was not only able to pick-and-place flat and flexible materials such as a porous cloth but also delicate objects such as a light bulb. By combining two soft touch sensors with the electroadhesive, an intelligent and shape-adaptive PneuEA material handling system has been developed. This work is expected to widen the applications of both soft gripper and electroadhesion technologies.}

        abstract = {As robots and other intelligent agents move from simple environments and problems to more complex, unstructured settings, manually programming their behavior has become increasingly challenging and expensive. Often, it is easier for a teacher to demonstrate a desired behavior rather than attempt to manually engineer it. This process of learning from demonstrations, and the study of algorithms to do so, is called imitation learning. This work provides an introduction to imitation learning. It covers the underlying assumptions, approaches, and how they relate; the rich set of algorithms developed to tackle the problem; and advice on effective tools and implementation. We intend this paper to serve two audiences. First, we want to familiarize machine learning experts with the challenges of imitation learning, particularly those arising in robotics, and the interesting theoretical and practical distinctions between it and more familiar frameworks like statistical supervised learning theory and reinforcement learning. Second, we want to give roboticists and experts in applied artificial intelligence a broader appreciation for the frameworks and tools available for imitation learning. We pay particular attention to the intimate connection between imitation learning approaches and those of structured prediction Daum{\'e} III et al. [2009]. To structure this discussion, we categorize imitation learning techniques based on the following key criteria which drive algorithmic decisions:

1) The structure of the policy space. Is the learned policy a time-index trajectory (trajectory learning), a mapping from observations to actions (so called behavioral cloning [Bain and Sammut, 1996]), or the result of a complex optimization or planning problem at each execution as is common in inverse optimal control methods [Kalman, 1964, Moylan and Anderson, 1973].

2) The information available during training and testing. In particular, is the learning algorithm privy to the full state that the teacher possess? Is the learner able to interact with the teacher and gather corrections or more data? Does the learner have a (typically a priori) model of the system with which it interacts? Does the learner have access to the reward (cost) function that the teacher is attempting to optimize?

3) The notion of success. Different algorithmic approaches provide varying guarantees on the resulting learned behavior. These guarantees range from weaker (e.g., measuring disagreement with the agent?s decision) to stronger (e.g., providing guarantees on the performance of the learner with respect to a true cost function, either known or unknown). We organize our work by paying particular attention to distinction (1): dividing imitation learning into directly replicating desired behavior (sometimes called behavioral cloning) and learning the hidden objectives of the desired behavior from demonstrations (called inverse optimal control or inverse reinforcement learning [Russell, 1998]). In the latter case, behavior arises as the result of an optimization problem solved for each new instance that the learner faces. In addition to method analysis, we discuss the design decisions a practitioner must make when selecting an imitation learning approach. Moreover, application examples{--}such as robots that play table tennis [Kober and Peters, 2009], programs that play the game of Go [Silver et al., 2016], and systems that understand natural language [Wen et al., 2015]{--} illustrate the properties and motivations behind different forms of imitation learning. We conclude by presenting a set of open questions and point towards possible future research directions for machine learning.}

behaviours to their audience. Traditional approaches, such as Bayesian Knowledge
Tracing, try to adapt the content of lessons or the difficulty of tasks to the current
estimated knowledge of the student. However, these variations only happen in a limited
domain, predefined in advance, and are not able to tackle unexpected variation in a
student's behaviours. We argue that robot adaptation needs to go beyond variations in
preprogrammed behaviours and that robots should in effect learn online how to become
better tutors. A study is currently being carried out to evaluate how human supervision
can teach a robot to support child learning during an educational game using one
implementation of this approach.}

Refrigeration systems, along with HVAC, are estimated to consume 14\% of the UK?s electricity and could have a significant role for DSR application. However, characterized by relatively low individual electrical loads and massive asset numbers, multiple low power refrigerators need aggregation for inclusion in these tariffs. In this paper, the impact of the Demand Side Response (DSR) control mechanisms on food retailing refrigeration systems is investigated. The experiments are conducted in a test-rig built to resemble a typical small supermarket store. The paper demonstrates how the temperature and pressure profiles of the system, the active power and the drawn current of the compressors are affected following a rapid shut down and subsequent return to normal operation as a response to a DSR event. Moreover, risks and challenges associated with primary and secondary Firm Frequency Response (FFR) mechanisms, where the load is rapidly shed at high speed in response to changes in grid frequency, is considered. For instance, measurements are included that show a significant increase in peak inrush currents of approx. 30\% when the system returns to normal operation at the end of a DSR event. Consideration of how high inrush currents after a DSR event can produce voltage fluctuations of the supply and we assess risks to the local power supply system.}

This can be formulated as a classification problem and addressed by learning a classifier, traditional machine learning classification methods very easily stick to local optima which can be caused by noises of data. Hence, we propose an unsupervised algorithm aiming at constructing a classifier based on self-paced learning. Self-paced learning is a recently developed supervised learning approach and
has been proven to be capable to overcome effectively this shortcoming. After applying a pre-classification to the difference image, we uniformly select samples using the initial result. Then, self-paced learning is utilized to train a classifier. Finally, a filter is used based on spatial contextual information to further smooth the classification result. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we apply our proposed algorithm on five real synthetic aperture radar images datasets. The results obtained by our algorithm are compared with five other state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates that our algorithm outperforms those state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness.}

In the last few decades, Earth Observation (EO) technology has played an increasingly important role in determining both ET and SSM. This paper reviews the state of the art in the use specifically of operational EO of both ET and SSM estimates. We discuss the key technical and operational considerations to derive accurate estimates of those parameters from space. The review suggests significant progress has been made in the recent years in retrieving ET and SSM operationally; yet, further work is required to optimize parameter accuracy and to improve the operational capability of services developed using EO data. Emerging applications on which ET/SSM operational products may be included in the context specifically in relation to agriculture are also highlighted; the operational use of those operational products in such applications remains to be seen.}

There is a growing consensus that virtual testing, where simulated AVs are deployed in simulated traffic, will be key for cost-effective testing and optimisation. The least mature model components in such simulations are those generating the behaviour of human agents in or around the AVs. In this paper, human models and virtual testing applications are presented for two example scenarios: (i) a human pedestrian deciding whether to cross a street in front of an approaching automated vehicle, with or without external human-machine interface elements, and (ii) an AV handing over control to a human driver in a critical rear-end situation. These scenarios have received much recent research attention, yet simulation-ready human behaviour models are lacking. They are discussed here in the context of existing models of perceptual decision-making, situational awareness, and traffic interactions. It is argued that the human behaviour in question might be usefully conceptualised as a number of interrelated decision processes, not all of which are necessarily directly associated with externally observable behaviour. The results show that models based on this type of framework can reproduce qualitative patterns of behaviour reported in the literature for the two addressed scenarios, and it is demonstrated how computer simulations based on the models, once these have been properly validated, could allow prediction and optimisation of  the AV.}

One way of constraining the policy change is by bounding the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence between successive policies. These approaches already demonstrated great experimental
success in challenging problems such as end-to-end control of physical systems.
However, these approaches lack any improvement guarantee as the linear approximation of
the system dynamics can introduce a bias in the policy update and prevent convergence
to the optimal policy. In this article, we propose a new model-free trajectory-based policy
optimization algorithm with guaranteed monotonic improvement. The algorithm backpropagates
a local, quadratic and time-dependent Q-Function learned from trajectory data
instead of a model of the system dynamics. Our policy update ensures exact KL-constraint
satisfaction without simplifying assumptions on the system dynamics. We experimentally
demonstrate on highly non-linear control tasks the improvement in performance of our algorithm
in comparison to approaches linearizing the system dynamics. In order to show the
monotonic improvement of our algorithm, we additionally conduct a theoretical analysis of
our policy update scheme to derive a lower bound of the change in policy return between
successive iterations.}

Knowledge of such preferences if collected in more realistic environments could then be used by future AVs to predict and control for pedestrian behaviour. This study is intended as a work-in-progress report on methods working towards real-time and less controlled experiments, demonstrating successful use of several key components required by such systems, but in its more controlled setting.

        abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must interact with other road users including pedestrians. Unlike passive environments, pedestrians are active agents having their own utilities and decisions, which must be inferred and predicted by AVs in order to control interactions with them and navigation around them. In particular, when a pedestrian wishes to cross the road in front of the vehicle at an unmarked crossing, the pedestrian and AV must compete for the space, which may be considered as a game-theoretic interaction in which one agent must yield to the other. To inform AV controllers in this setting, this study collects and analyses data from real-world human road crossings to determine what features of crossing behaviours are predictive about the level of assertiveness of pedestrians and of the eventual winner of the interactions. It presents the largest and most detailed data set of its kind known to us, and new methods to analyze and predict pedestrian-vehicle interactions based upon it. Pedestrian-vehicle interactions are decomposed into sequences of independent discrete events. We use probabilistic methods ?logistic regression and decision tree regression ? and sequence analysis to analyze sets and sub-sequences of actions used by both pedestrians and human drivers while crossing at an intersection, to find common patterns of behaviour and to predict the winner of each interaction. We report on the particular features found to be predictive and which can thus be integrated into game-theoretic AV controllers to inform real-time interactions.}

The Simulink model is based on fundamental thermodynamics and allows the implementation of correlation coefficients in the GGT module to predict the performance of the IGT system during a hot-end GGT damage incident. Measured field data from a twin-shaft IGT operated as a power generation unit denoting a reduction in performance due to hot-end GGT damage are considered for the analysis. Four hot-end GGT damage incidents across a range of measured field data have been identified and considered for the analysis. The results show that the Simulink model can predict the change of physical parameters (pressure, temperature) across the IGT system for each GGT damage incident. Hot-end damage increases the flow capacity and reduces the efficiency of the GGT.  Future work will validate the dynamic change of flow capacity and efficiency during different GGT damage incidents.}

This article investigates the automation of the masking process utilising the well-established time?pressure dispensing process for controlled maskant dispensing and a robotic manipulator for accurate part handling. A mathematical model for the time?pressure dispensing process was derived, extending previous models from the literature by incorporating the robot velocity for controlled masking line width. An experiment was designed, based on the theoretical analysis of the dispensing process, to derive an empirical model from the generated data that incorporate the losses that are otherwise difficult to model mathematically. The model was validated under new input conditions to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach and the masking accuracy using the derived model.}

A soft bending actuator following a pleated morphology, as well as a flexible resistive strain sensor, were directly 3D printed using easily accessible FDM printer hardware with a dual-extrusion tool head. The flexible sensor was directly welded to the bending actuator?s body and systematically tested to characterize and evaluate its response under variable input pressure. A signal conditioning circuit was developed to enhance the quality of the sensory feedback, and flexible conductive threads were used for wiring. The sensorized actuator?s response was then calibrated using a vision system to convert the sensory readings to real bending angle values. The empirical relationship was derived using linear regression and validated at untrained input conditions to evaluate its accuracy. Furthermore, the sensorized actuator was tested in a constrained setup that prevents bending, to evaluate the potential of using the same sensor for simple contact detection by comparing the constrained and free-bending responses at the same input pressures. The results of this work demonstrated how a dual-extrusion FDM printing process can be tuned to directly print highly customizable flexible strain sensors that were able to provide reliable bending feedback and basic contact detection. The addition of such sensing capability to bending actuators enhances their functionality and reliability for applications such as controlled soft grasping, flexible wearables, and haptic devices.}

However, the contact forces are still hard to regulate due to missing contact feedback of such grippers. In this paper, a modular soft gripper design is presented utilizing interchangeable soft pneumatic actuators with embedded flex sensors as fingers of the gripper. The fingers can be assembled in different configurations using 3D printed connectors. The paper investigates the potential of utilizing the simple sensory feedback from the flex sensors to make additional meaningful inferences regarding the contact state and grasped object size. We study the effect of the grasped object size and contact type on the combined feedback from the embedded flex sensors of all fingers. Our results show that a simple linear relationship exists between the grasped object size and the final flex sensor reading at fixed input conditions, despite the variation in object weight and contact type. Additionally, by simply monitoring the time series response from the flex sensor, contact can be detected by comparing the response to the known free-bending response at the same input conditions. Furthermore, by utilizing the measured internal pressure supplied to the soft fingers, it is possible to distinguish between power and pinch grasps, as the nature of the contact affects the rate of change in the flex sensor readings against the internal pressure.}

The protocols are based on histograms that encode the local neighborhood relations of the gents

Autonomous systems have a long history in the fields of AI and robotics. However, only through recent advances in technology has it been possible to create autonomous systems capable of operating in long-term, real-world scenarios. Examples include autonomous robots that operate outdoors on land, in air, water, and space; and indoors in offices, care homes, and factories. Designing, developing, and maintaining intelligent autonomous systems that operate in real-world environments over long periods of time, i.e. weeks, months, or years, poses many challenges. This special issue focuses on such challenges and on ways to overcome them using methods from AI. Long-term autonomy can be viewed as both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge of long-term autonomy requires system designers to ensure that an autonomous system can continue operating successfully according to its real-world application demands in unstructured and semi-structured environments. This means addressing issues related to hardware and software robustness (e.g., gluing in screws and profiling for memory leaks), as well as ensuring that all modules and functions of the system can deal with the variation in the environment and tasks that is expected to occur over its operating time.}

Whilst several reports of the Martian surface have indicated the presence of duricrusts, none have been able to provide details on the physical properties of the material, which may indicate the level of safe traversability of duricrust terrains. This paper presents the findings of testing terrestrially-created duricrusts with simulated Martian soil properties, in order to determine the properties of such duricrusts and to discover what level of hazard that they may represent (e.g. can vehicles traverse the duricrust surface without penetration to lower sub-surface soils?). Combinations of elements that have been observed in the Martian soil were used as the basis for forming the laboratory-created duricrusts. Variations in duricrust thickness, water content, and the iron oxide compound were investigated. As was observed throughout the testing process, duricrusts behave in a rather brittle fashion and are easily destroyed by low surface pressures. This indicates that duricrusts are not safe for traversing and they present a definite hazard for travelling on the Martian landscape when utilising only visual terrain classification, as the surface appearance is not necessarily representative of what may be lying beneath.}

We present a new energy preserving design based on a spring-augmented pendulum. We indirectly control the friction-induced stick-slip motions by exploiting the passive dynamics in order to achieve an improvement in overall travelling distance and energy efficacy. Both collocated and non-collocated constraint conditions are elaborately analysed and considered to obtain a desired trajectory generation profile. For tracking control, we develop a partial feedback controller which for the pendulum which counteracts the dynamic contributions from the platform. Comparative simulation studies show the effectiveness and intriguing performance of the proposed approach, while its feasibility is experimentally verified through a physical robot. Our robot is to the best of our knowledge the first nonlinear-motion prototype in literature towards the VDR systems.}

        abstract = {As robots and other intelligent agents move from simple environments and problems to more complex, unstructured settings, manually programming their behavior has become increasingly challenging and expensive. Often, it is easier for a teacher to demonstrate a desired behavior rather than attempt to manually engineer it. This process of learning from demonstrations, and the study of algorithms to do so, is called imitation learning. This work provides an introduction to imitation learning. It covers the underlying assumptions, approaches, and how they relate; the rich set of algorithms developed to tackle the problem; and advice on effective tools and implementation. We intend this paper to serve two audiences. First, we want to familiarize machine learning experts with the challenges of imitation learning, particularly those arising in robotics, and the interesting theoretical and practical distinctions between it and more familiar frameworks like statistical supervised learning theory and reinforcement learning. Second, we want to give roboticists and experts in applied artificial intelligence a broader appreciation for the frameworks and tools available for imitation learning. We pay particular attention to the intimate connection between imitation learning approaches and those of structured prediction Daum{\'e} III et al. [2009]. To structure this discussion, we categorize imitation learning techniques based on the following key criteria which drive algorithmic decisions:

1) The structure of the policy space. Is the learned policy a time-index trajectory (trajectory learning), a mapping from observations to actions (so called behavioral cloning [Bain and Sammut, 1996]), or the result of a complex optimization or planning problem at each execution as is common in inverse optimal control methods [Kalman, 1964, Moylan and Anderson, 1973].

2) The information available during training and testing. In particular, is the learning algorithm privy to the full state that the teacher possess? Is the learner able to interact with the teacher and gather corrections or more data? Does the learner have a (typically a priori) model of the system with which it interacts? Does the learner have access to the reward (cost) function that the teacher is attempting to optimize?

3) The notion of success. Different algorithmic approaches provide varying guarantees on the resulting learned behavior. These guarantees range from weaker (e.g., measuring disagreement with the agent?s decision) to stronger (e.g., providing guarantees on the performance of the learner with respect to a true cost function, either known or unknown). We organize our work by paying particular attention to distinction (1): dividing imitation learning into directly replicating desired behavior (sometimes called behavioral cloning) and learning the hidden objectives of the desired behavior from demonstrations (called inverse optimal control or inverse reinforcement learning [Russell, 1998]). In the latter case, behavior arises as the result of an optimization problem solved for each new instance that the learner faces. In addition to method analysis, we discuss the design decisions a practitioner must make when selecting an imitation learning approach. Moreover, application examples{--}such as robots that play table tennis [Kober and Peters, 2009], programs that play the game of Go [Silver et al., 2016], and systems that understand natural language [Wen et al., 2015]{--} illustrate the properties and motivations behind different forms of imitation learning. We conclude by presenting a set of open questions and point towards possible future research directions for machine learning.}

        abstract = {Refrigeration systems and HVAC are estimated to consume approximately 14\% of the UK?s electricity and could make a significant contribution towards the application of DSR. In this paper, active power profiles of single and multi-pack refrigeration systems responding DSR events are experimentally investigated. Further, a large population of 300 packs (approx. 1.5 MW capacity) is simulated to investigate the potential of delivering DSR using a network of refrigeration compressors, in common with commercial retail refrigeration systems. Two scenarios of responding to DSR are adopted for the studies viz. with and without applying a suction pressure offset after an initial 30 second shut-down of the compressors. The experiments are conducted at the Refrigeration Research Centre at University of Lincoln. Simulations of the active power profile for the compressors following triggered DSR events are realized based on a previously reported model of the thermodynamic properties of the refrigeration system. A Simulink model of a three phase power supply system is used to determine the impact of compressor operation on the power system performance, and in particular, on the line voltage of the local power supply system. The authors demonstrate how the active power and the drawn current of the multi-pack refrigeration system are affected following a rapid shut down and subsequent return to operation. Specifically, it is shown that there is a significant increase in power consumption post DSR, approximately two times higher than during normal operation, particularly when many packs of compressors are synchronized post DSR event, which can have a significant effect on the line voltage of the power supply.}

We achieve this by using a variant of ASPIC+ and a higher-order typed language that can reference object-level formulae and arguments. We illustrate these representational advantages with a running example from clinical decision support.}
