The work presented here investigates the application of argumentation-based dialogue games as the means to facilitate flexible interaction, including unscripted changes in initiative. Two main contributions are provided in this paper. First, a methodology for implementing multiple types of argumentation-based dialogues for human-robot interaction is detailed. This includes explanation about which types of dialogues are appropriate given the beliefs of the participants and how multiple dialogues can occur simultaneously while maintaining a consistent set of beliefs for the participants. Second, a formal definition is presented for the Treasure Hunt Game (THG), a test environment that provides rich opportunities for experimentation in shared human-robot control, as well as motivating and engaging experiences for human subjects.}

        abstract = {Spatial interactions between agents (humans, animals, or machines) carry information of high value to human or electronic observers. However, not all the information contained in a pair of continuous trajectories is important and thus the need for qualitative descriptions of interaction trajectories arises. The Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) (Van de Weghe, 2004) is a promising development towards this goal. Numerous variants of QTC have been proposed in the past and QTC has been applied towards analyzing various interaction domains. However, an inherent limitation of those QTC variations that deal with lateral movements is that they are limited to two-dimensional motion; therefore, complex three-dimensional interactions, such as those occurring between flying planes or birds, cannot be captured. Towards that purpose, in this paper QTC3D is presented: a novel qualitative trajectory calculus that can deal with full three-dimensional interactions. QTC3D is based on transformations of the Frenet-Serret frames accompanying the trajectories of the moving objects. Apart from the theoretical exposition, including definition and properties, as well as computational aspects, we also present an application of QTC3D towards modeling bird flight. Thus, the power of QTC is now extended to the full dimensionality of physical space, enabling succinct yet rich representations of spatial interactions between agents.}

Moreover, the processes' behaviour in the presence of noise is considered, leading to the development of a statistical approach for determining a decision threshold.

The initial positive results from the study indicate a potential for such activities to enhance teaching experience and practice at African institutions. The proposed integrated set-up including robotic hardware, software and educational tasks was effective and will form a solid base for a future, full scale integration of robotic activities into the undergraduate curricula at this particular institution. This evaluation should be valuable to other educators integrating educational robots into undergraduate curricula in developing countries and elsewhere.}

This will allow robots to be better colleagues, by anticipating an individual's actions, and acting accordingly. In this paper, we present a way of encoding a human's course of action as a probabilistic sequence of qualitative states, and show that such a model can be employed to identify individual humans from their respective course of action, even when accomplishing the very same goal state. We conclude from our findings that there are significant variations in the ways humans accomplish the very same task, and that our representation could in future work inform robot (task) planning in collaborative settings.}

Considering sensor signals that are highly correlated in a sensor network, one sensor measurement can be reconstructed based on measurements from other sensors. In such cases, three signal reconstruction methods are considered: 1) principal component analysis (PCA) based missing value approach; 2) self-organizing map neural network (SOMNN) based algorithm; and 3) an analytical optimization (AO) technique. To demonstrate the efficacy of the methods, temperature data are studied on an industrial gas turbine system, where, especially, a faulty sensor signal is utilized to be reconstructed from the other sensor measurements.}

In particular, the work here presented adopts a new 3D Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC3D) to represent human actions that belong to such activities, designing and implementing a set of computational tools (i.e. Hidden Markov Models) to learn and classify them from standard datasets. Preliminary results show the good performance of our system and its potential application to a large number of scenarios, including mobile robots for AAL.}

        abstract = {Various ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies have been proposed for improving the living conditions of elderly people. One of them is to introduce robots to reduce dependency on support staff. The tasks commonly encountered in a healthcare facility such as a care home for elderly people are heterogeneous and are of different priorities. A care home environment is also dynamic and new emergency priority tasks, which if not attended shortly may result in fatal situations, may randomly appear. Therefore, it is better to use a multi-robot system (MRS) consisting of heterogeneous robots than designing a single robot capable of doing all tasks. An efficient task allocation algorithm capable of handling the dynamic nature of the environment, the heterogeneity of robots and tasks, and the prioritisation of tasks is required to reap the benefits of introducing an MRS.
This paper proposes Consensus Based Parallel Auction and Execution (CBPAE), a distributed algorithm for task allocation in a system of multiple heterogeneous autonomous robots deployed in a healthcare facility, based on auction and consensus principles. Unlike many of the existing market based task allocation algorithms, which use a time extended allocation of tasks before the actual execution is initialised, the proposed algorithm uses a parallel auction and execution framework, and is thus suitable for highly dynamic real world environments. The robots continuously resolve any conflicts in the bids on tasks using inter-robot communication and a consensus process in each robot before a task is assigned to a robot. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CBPAE by comparing its simulation results with those of an existing market based distributed multi-robot task allocation algorithm and through experiments on real robots.}

It is particularly used by social insects such as bees, ants and termites; both for inter-agent and agent-swarm communications. Due to its effectiveness; artificial pheromones have been adopted in multi-robot and swarm robotic systems for more than a decade. Although, pheromone-based communication was implemented by different means like chemical (use of particular chemical compounds) or physical (RFID tags, light, sound) ways, none of them were able to replicate all the aspects of pheromones as seen in nature. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial pheromone system that is reliable, accurate and it uses off-the-shelf components only -- LCD screen and low-cost USB camera. The system allows to simulate several pheromones and their interactions and to change parameters of the pheromones (diffusion, evaporation, etc.) on the fly allowing for controllable experiments. We tested the performance of the system using the Colias platform in single-robot and swarm scenarios. To allow the swarm robotics community to use the system for their research, we provide it as a freely available open-source package.}

The model, described through a dynamical system, is actuated with an open-loop control and exhibits self-stabilizing running, represented by the limit cycle of the system, on flat terrain. By introducing a simulated uneven terrain and by keeping the same open-loop control, it appears that the self-stable gait is not affected by disturbances until a certain threshold, when the robot falls to the ground. Moreover, the stability appears to be proportional to the density of the robot and inversely proportional to the drag coefficient of the body, thus suggesting some criteria for the design of underwater running robots.}

This vehicle consists of an elastic shell which propels itself via the discontinuous expulsion and ingestion of finite slugs of ambient water, resulting in a pulsated routine. The activation routine involves the collapse of the elastic shell via cable transmission and its subsequent passive inflation driven by the elastic energy stored in the strained shell walls. Earlier analysis by the authors have found that the thrust generated at each pulsation depends massively on the resilience of the elastic material which composes the shell. In order to improve the design of these vehicle it is thus necessary to characterize the dynamic behaviour of the elastic shell during its stage of inflation by resorting to a coupled potential flow-elastodynamics model. The results enable to better parametrize the thrust model so far employed for this kind of vehicles and in this way achieve a more rigorous description of the vehicle dynamics for design and control purposes.}

        abstract = {Two Lobula Giant Movement Detectors (LGMDs) have been identified in the lobula region of the locust visual system: LGMD1 and LGMD2. LGMD1 had been successfully used in robot navigation to avoid impending collision. LGMD2 also responds to looming stimuli in depth, and shares most the same properties with LGMD1; however, LGMD2 has its specific collision selective responds when dealing with different visual stimulus. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel way to model LGMD2, in order to emulate its predicted bio-functions, moreover, to solve some defects of previous LGMD1 computational models. The mechanism of ON and OFF cells, as well as bioinspired nonlinear functions, are introduced in our model, to achieve LGMD2?s collision selectivity. Our model has been tested by a miniature mobile robot in real time. The results suggested this model has an ideal performance in both software and hardware for collision recognition.}

        abstract = {In recent years a number of robotic platforms have been developed, that are capable of robust locomotion in presence of a simple open loop control. Relying on the self-stabilizing properties of their mechanical structure, morphology assumes a crucial role in the design process, that is, however, usually guided by a set of heuristic principles falling under what is commonly known as embodied intelligence. Despite many impressive demonstrations, the result of such a methodology may be sub-optimal, given the dimension of the design space and the complex intertwining of involved dynamical effects. Encouraged by the growing consensus that embodied solutions can indeed be produced by bio-inspired computational techniques in a more automated manner, this work proposes a computer-aided methodology to explore in simulation the design space of an existing robot, by harnessing computational techniques inspired by natural evolution. Although many works exist on the application of evolutionary algorithms in robotics, few of them embrace this design perspective. The idea is to have an evolutionary process suggesting to the human designer a number of interesting robot configurations and embodied behaviors, from whose analysis design hints can be gained to improve the platform. The focus will be on enhancing the locomotion capabilities of a multi-legged, soft, underwater robot. We investigate for the first time the suitability of a recently introduced open-ended evolutionary algorithm (novelty search) for the intended study, and demonstrate its benefits in the comparison with a more conventional genetic algorithm. Results confirm that evolutionary algorithms are indeed capable of producing new, elaborate dynamic gaits, with evolved designs exhibiting several regularities. Possible future directions are also pointed out, in which the passive exploitation of robot's morphological features could bring additional advantages in achieving diverse, robust behaviors.}

Our method assumes that the world is subject to perpetual change, which adds an extra, temporal dimension to the explored space and makes the exploration task a never-ending data-gathering process. To create and maintain a spatio-temporal model of a dynamic environment, the robot has to determine not only where, but also when to perform observations.  We address the problem by application of information-theoretic exploration to world representations that model the uncertainty of environment states as probabilistic functions of time.

We compare the performance of different exploration strategies and temporal models on real-world data gathered over the course of several months and show that combination of dynamic environment representations with information-gain exploration principles allows to create and maintain up-to-date models of constantly changing environments.}

We argue that in the given long-term scenario, the viewpoint, scale and rotation invariance of the standard feature extractors is less important than their robustness to the mid- and long-term environment appearance changes. Therefore, we focus our evaluation on the robustness of image registration to variable lighting and naturally-occurring seasonal changes.  We evaluate the image feature extractors on three datasets collected by mobile robots in two different outdoor environments over the course of one year. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel feature descriptor based on a combination of evolutionary algorithms and Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features, which we call GRIEF (Generated BRIEF). In terms of robustness to seasonal changes, the GRIEF feature descriptor outperforms the other ones while being computationally more efficient.}

We propose a straightforward tool to inform researchers of the most promising methods available to reduce selection bias and to assist the search for an appropriate method given their study design and details. We demonstrate the tool using three exam- ples where selection bias may occur; the tool quickly eliminates inappropriate methods and guides the researcher towards those to consider implementing.

Two different types of propulsive actions are embedded into the robot model: reaction forces due to leg contact with the ground and hydrodynamic forces such as the drag arising from the sculling motion of the legs. Dynamic parameters of the model are estimated by means of evolutionary techniques and subsequently the model is exploited to highlight some distinctive features of ULL. Specifically, the separation between the center of buoyancy (CoB)/center of mass and density affect the stability and speed of the robot, whereas the sculling movements contribute to propelling the robot even when its legs are detached from the ground. The relevance of these effects is demonstrated through robotic experiments and model simulations; moreover, by slightly changing the position of the CoB in the presence of the same feed-forward activation, a number of different behaviors (i.e. forward and backward locomotion at different speeds) are achieved.}

The analysis of the literature reveals that only in few cases the possibility of a temporal evolution of the co-adaptation parameters has been considered. In particular, it has been overlooked the role of time-related indexes that capture changes in motor and cognitive abilities of the human operator. We argue that for a more effective long-term co-adaptation process, the interface should be able to predict and adjust its parameters according to the evolution of human skills and performance. We thus propose a novel approach termed progressive co-adaptation, whereby human performance is continuously monitored and the system makes inferences about changes in the users' cognitive and motor skills. We illustrate the features of progressive co-adaptation in two possible applications, robotic telemanipulation and active vision for the visually impaired.}

Current techniques capable of mapping this input-output response involve computational combinations of linear and nonlinear models that are generally complex and lack any relevance to the underlying biophysics. This paper aims to model a retinal ganglion cell with a simple spiking neuron combined with a pre-processing method, which accounts for the preceding retinal neural structure. Performance of the models is compared with the spike responses obtained in the electrophysiological recordings from a mammalian retina subjected to visual stimulation.}

In this context morphological design is usually performed by humans, following a set of heuristic principles: in general this can be limiting, both from an engineering and an artificial life perspectives. In this work we thus suggest a different approach, leveraging evolutionary techniques. The case study is the one of improving the locomotion capabilities of an existing bioinspired robot. First, we explore the behavior space of the robot to discover a number of qualitatively different morphology-enabled behaviors, from whose analysis design indications are gained. The suitability of novelty search -- a recent open-ended evolutionary algorithm -- for this intended purpose is demonstrated. Second, we show how it is possible to condense such behaviors into a reconfigurable robot capable of online morphological adaptation (morphosis, morphing). Examples of successful morphing are demonstrated, in which changing just one morphological parameter entails a dramatic change in the behavior: this is promising for a future robot design. The approach here adopted represents a novel computed-aided, bioinspired, design paradigm, merging human and artificial creativity. This may result in interesting implications also for artificial life, having the potential to contribute in exploring underwater locomotion "as-it-could-be".}

Moreover, standard DMP learning does not cope with the noise inherent to human demonstrations.

Under this framework, the temporal weight sequences of each synergy from pregrasp phase to grasp phase are required for reproducing any grasping task. Moreover, the zero-offset posture has to be preset before starting any grasp. Thus, the whole grasp phase appears to be unlike natural human grasp. Up until now, no work in the literature addresses these issues toward simplifying the continual grasp by only inputting the grasp pattern. In this paper, the kinematic synergies observed in angular velocity profile are employed to design the motion generation mechanism. The kinematic synergy extracted from quantities of grasp tasks is implemented by the proposed eigen cam group in tendon space. The completely continual grasp from the fully extending posture only require averagely rotating the two eigen cam groups one cycle. The change of grasp pattern only depends on respecifying transmission ratio pair for the two eigen cam groups. An illustrated hand prototype is developed based on the proposed design principle and the grasping experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the design method. The potential applications include the prosthetic hand that is controlled by the classified pattern from the bio-signal.}

In order to achieve this goal, we present a method to locate regions of interest automatically based on a novel adaptive mean shift segmentation algorithm to obtain saliency objects. In the proposed mean shift algorithm, we use adaptive Bayesian bandwidth to find the convergence of all data points by iterations and the k-nearest neighborhood queries. Experiments showed that the proposed algorithm is efficient, and yields better visual salient regions comparing with ground-truth benchmark. The proposed algorithm continuously outperformed other known visual saliency methods, generated higher precision and better recall rates, when challenged with natural scenes collected locally and one of the largest publicly available data sets. The proposed algorithm can also be extended naturally to detect moving vehicles in dynamic scenes once integrated with top-down shape biased cues, as demonstrated in our experiments. {\^A}{\copyright} 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.}

        abstract = {This work addresses the inverse kinematics problem of a bioinspired octopus-like manipulator moving in three-dimensional space. The bioinspired manipulator has a conical soft structure that confers the ability of twirling around objects as a real octopus arm does. Despite the simple design, the soft conical shape manipulator driven by cables is described by nonlinear differential equations, which are difficult to solve analytically. Since exact solutions of the equations are not available, the Jacobian matrix cannot be calculated analytically and the classical iterative methods cannot be used. To overcome the intrinsic problems of methods based on the Jacobian matrix, this paper proposes a neural network learning the inverse kinematics of a soft octopus-like manipulator driven by cables. After the learning phase, a feed-forward neural network is able to represent the relation between manipulator tip positions and forces applied to the cables. Experimental results show that a desired tip position can be achieved in a short time, since heavy computations are avoided, with a degree of accuracy of 8\% relative average error with respect to the total arm length.}

However, in human populated environments mere obstacle avoidance is not sufficient to make humans feel comfortable and safe around robots. To this end, a large community is currently producing human-aware navigation approaches to create a more socially acceptable robot behaviour. Amajorbuilding block for all Human-Robot Spatial Interaction is the ability of detecting and tracking humans in the vicinity of the robot. We present a fully integrated people perception framework, designed to run in real-time on a mobile robot. This framework employs detectors based on laser and RGB-D data and a tracking approach able to fuse multiple detectors using different versions of data association and Kalman filtering. The resulting trajectories are transformed into Qualitative Spatial Relations based on a Qualitative Trajectory Calculus, to learn and classify different encounters using a Hidden Markov Model based representation. We present this perception pipeline, which is fully implemented into the Robot Operating System (ROS), in a small proof of concept experiment. All components are readily available for download, and free to use under the MIT license, to researchers in all fields, especially focussing on social interaction learning by providing different kinds of output, i.e. Qualitative Relations and trajectories.}

Consideration of the world dynamics adds an extra, temporal dimension to the explored space and makes the exploration task a never-ending data-gathering process to keep the robot's environment model up-to-date.
Thus, the crucial question is not only where, but also when to observe the explored environment. 
We address the problem by application of information-theoretic exploration to world representations that model the environment states' uncertainties as probabilistic functions of time. The predictive ability of the spatio-temporal model allows the exploration method to decide not only where, but also when to make environment observations. 

To verify the proposed approach, an evaluation of several exploration strategies and spatio-temporal models was carried out using real-world data gathered over several months. The evaluation indicates that through understanding of the environment dynamics, the proposed spatio-temporal exploration method could predict which locations were going to change at a specific time and use this knowledge to guide the robot.  Such an ability is crucial for long-term deployment of mobile robots in human-populated spaces that change over time.}

We formulate the search as a path planning problem in an environment where the probability of object occurrences at particular locations is a function of time. We propose to explicitly model the dynamics of the object occurrences by their frequency spectra. Using this spectral model, our path planning algorithm can construct plans that reflect the likelihoods of object locations at the time the search is performed. Three datasets collected over several months containing person and object occurrences in residential and office environments were chosen to evaluate the approach. Several types of spatio-temporal models were created for each of these datasets and the efficiency of the search method was assessed by measuring the time it took to locate a particular object. The results indicate that modeling the dynamics of object occurrences reduces the search time by 25\% to 65\% compared to maps that neglect these dynamics.}

Rather than using a fixed probability value, the method models the uncertainty of the elementary environment states by probabilistic functions of time. These are composed of combinations of harmonic functions, which are obtained by means of frequency analysis. The use of frequency analysis allows to integrate long-term observations into memory-efficient spatio-temporal models that reflect the mid- to long-term environment dynamics. These frequency-enhanced spatio-temporal models allow to predict the future environment states, which improves the efficiency of mobile robot operation in changing environments.   In a series of experiments performed over periods of days to years, we demonstrate that the proposed approach improves localization, path planning and exploration.}

It lies in the nature of planning that it has to make assumptions about the future state of the world, and the robot?s chances of successively accomplishing actions in this future.
Hence, a robot?s plan can only be as good as its predictions about the world. In this paper, we present a novel approach to specifically represent changes that stem from periodic events in the environment (e.g. a door being opened or closed), which impact on the success probability of planned actions. We show that our approach to model the probability of action success as a set of superimposed periodic processes allows the robot to predict action outcomes in a long-term data obtained in two real-life offices better than a static model. We furthermore discuss and showcase how this knowledge gathered can be successfully employed in a probabilistic planning framework to devise better navigation plans. The key contributions of this paper are (i) the formation of the spectral model of action outcomes from non-uniform sampling, the (ii) analysis of its predictive power using two long-term datasets, and (iii) the application of the predicted outcomes in an MDP-based planning framework.}

The OCTOPUS robot presented here is a completely soft robot, which integrates eight arms extending in radial direction and a central body which contains the main processing units. The front arms are mainly used for elongation and grasping, while the others are mainly used for locomotion. The robotic octopus works in water and its buoyancy is close to neutral. The experimental results show that the octopus-inspired robot can walk in water using the same strategy as the animal model, with good performance over different surfaces, including walking through physical constraints. It can grasp objects of different sizes and shapes, thanks to its soft arm materials and conical shape.}

One such artificial system consists of one artificial fly visual neural network model and one collision detection mechanism. The former one is a computational model to capture membrane potentials produced by neurons. The latter one takes the outputs of the former one as its inputs, and executes three detection schemes: (i) identifying when a spike takes place through the membrane potentials and one threshold scheme; (ii) deciding the motion direction of a moving object by the Reichardt detector model; and (iii) sending collision alarms and collision regions. Experimentally, relying upon a series of video image sequences with different scenes, numerical results illustrated that the artificial system with some striking characteristics is a potentially alternative tool for collision detection.}

Since the necessity of real robots (as opposed to virtual agents) in education has not been definitively established in the literature, the effect of robot embodiment is assessed. The results demonstrate that children overcome strong incorrect biases in the material to be learned, but with no significant dif- ferences between embodiment conditions.

        abstract = {In this paper we propose a probabilistic sequential model of Human-Robot Spatial Interaction (HRSI) using a well-established Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) to encode HRSI between a human and a mobile robot in a meaningful, tractable, and systematic manner. Our key contribution is to utilise QTC as a state descriptor and model HRSI as a probabilistic sequence of such states. Apart from the sole direction of movements of human and robot modelled by QTC, attributes of HRSI like proxemics and velocity profiles play vital roles for the modelling and generation of HRSI behaviour. In this paper, we particularly present how the concept of proxemics can be embedded in QTC to facilitate richer models. To facilitate reasoning on HRSI with qualitative representations, we show how we can combine the representational power of QTC with the concept of proxemics in a concise framework, enriching our probabilistic representation by implicitly modelling distances. We show the appropriateness of our sequential model of QTC by encoding different HRSI behaviours observed in two spatial interaction experiments. We classify these encounters, creating a comparative measurement, showing the representational capabilities of the model.}

        abstract = {Social robots are finding increasing application in the domain of education, particularly for children, to support and augment learning opportunities. With an implicit assumption that social and adaptive behaviour is desirable, it is therefore of interest to determine precisely how these aspects of behaviour may be exploited in robots to support children in their learning. In this paper, we explore this issue by evaluating the effect of a social robot tutoring strategy with children learning about prime numbers. It is shown that the tutoring strategy itself leads to improvement, but that the presence of a robot employing this strategy amplifies this effect, resulting in significant learning. However, it was also found that children interacting with a robot using social and adaptive behaviours in addition to the teaching strategy did not learn a significant amount. These results indicate that while the presence of a physical robot leads to improved learning, caution is required when applying social behaviour to a robot in a tutoring context.}

In contrast to other approaches that rely on static image features, our method explicitly models the temporal dynamics of the visibility of image features.

This approach improves the robot localisation capabilities during long-term operations.}

This paper describes a successful application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for training intelligent agents with strategic conversational skills, in a situated dialogue setting. Previous studies have modelled the behaviour of strategic agents using supervised learning and traditional reinforcement learning techniques, the latter using tabular representations or learning with linear function approximation. In this study, we apply DRL with a high-dimensional state space to the strategic board game of Settlers of Catan---where players can offer resources in exchange for others and they can also reply to offers made by other players. Our experimental results report that the DRL-based learnt policies significantly outperformed several baselines including random, rule-based, and supervised-based behaviours. The DRL-based policy has a 53\% win rate versus 3 automated players (`bots'), whereas a supervised player trained on a dialogue corpus in this setting achieved only 27\%, versus the same 3 bots. This result supports the claim that DRL is a promising framework for training dialogue systems, and strategic agents with negotiation abilities.}

Several versions of the null space property, that is, the lq stable NSP, the lq robust NSP, and the lq,p robust NSP for 0{\ensuremath{<}}p{$\leq$}q{\ensuremath{<}}1 based on the standard lq NSP, are proposed, and their equivalent forms are derived. Consequently, reconstruction results for the lq-minimization can be derived easily under the NSP condition and its equivalent form. Finally, the lq NSP is extended to the lq-synthesis modeling and the mixed l2/lq-minimization, which deals with the dictionary-based sparse signals and the block sparse signals, respectively. {\copyright} 2015 Yi Gao et al}
