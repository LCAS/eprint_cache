        abstract = {The design of a pneumatically actuated silicone module, resembling soft tissue, with three pneumatic chambers is considered and optimized in this study with the aim of using it in a soft robot arm for robotic surgery applications. Three types of silicone materials, Ecoflex 0030 and 0050 and Dragonskin 0030, have been investigated, and a constitutive model has been derived for each of them. Design optimization of the silicone module was based on finite element analysis (FEA) that was validated against experimental data of one-degree bending under one-channel actuation. This was followed by FEA parametric studies for module design optimization to minimize the ballooning effect in one-degree bending as well as reduce the actuation pressure. Modules made from Ecoflex 0030 and Ecoflex 0050 exhibited the same bending shape in FEA, but about three times higher actuation pressure was required for the harder Ecoflex 0050. Design parameters under investigation in the parametric FEA studies included the shape of the pneumatic channel cross section, the ratio of channel length to module length, the distance of channel from the module wall, and the ratio of channel to module cross-sectional area. After FEA design optimization yielded least ballooning for pneumatic chambers of semicircular cross section, an internal dragonskin structure was added internally below the module surface to enable and guide the bending under one-channel pneumatic actuation and further contain the ballooning effect: the benefits of this design were successfully verified under both FEA and experimental analysis.}

However certain types of tasks require a team of robots for their execution, and for the allocation of such tasks non-conflicting robot teams have to be formed. Most of the existing allocation algorithms for such tasks mainly address the robot-team formation and the tasks are allocated sequentially. However, allocating multiple tasks simultaneously will result in a more balanced distribution of robots into teams. A market based algorithm for simultaneous allocation of multiple tightly couple multi-robot tasks to coalitions of heterogeneous robots are proposed in this paper. The simultaneous allocations are deadlock-free and significant improvement in overall execution time is achieved as demonstrated by empirical evaluations.}

        abstract = {Current approaches to networked robot systems (or ecology of robots and sensors) in ambient assisted living applications (AAL) rely on pre-programmed models of the environment and do not evolve to address novel states of the environment. Envisaged as part of a robotic ecology in an AAL environment to provide different services based on the events and user activities, a Markov based approach to establishing a user behavioural model through the use of a cognitive memory module is presented in this paper. Upon detecting changes in the normal user behavioural pattern, the ecology tries to adapt its response to these changes in an intelligent manner. The approach is evaluated with physical robots and an experimental evaluation is presented in this paper. A major challenge associated with data storage in a sensor rich environment is the expanding memory requirements. In order to address this, a bio-inspired data retention strategy is also proposed. These contributions can enable a robotic ecology to adapt to evolving environmental states while efficiently managing the memory footprint.}

The core component of the software is a novel and efficient algorithm for black and white pattern detection.

With off-the-shelf computational equipment and low-cost cameras, the core algorithm is able to process hundreds of images per second while tracking hundreds of objects with a millimeter precision. In addition, we present the method's mathematical model, which allows to estimate the expected localization precision, area of coverage, and processing speed from the camera's intrinsic parameters and hardware's processing capacity. The correctness of the presented model and performance of the algorithm in real-world conditions is verified in several experiments.  Apart from the method description, we also make its source code public at {$\backslash$}emph\{http://purl.org/robotics/whycon\}; so, it can be used as an enabling technology for various mobile robotic problems.}

Numerous parameters such as the member shapes and sizes, the elasticity modulus of material, the locations of nodes and the support constraints can be selected as design variables. These variables are progressively revised in order to obtain a satisfactory structure. Each modification requires a fresh analysis for the displacements and stresses, and reanalysis can be employed to reduce the computational cost. This paper is focused on static reanalysis problem with modification of deleting some supports. An efficient reanalysis method is proposed. The method makes full use of the initial information and preserves the ease of implementation. Numerical examples show that the calculated results of the proposed method are the identical as those of the direct analysis, while the computational time is remarkably reduced.}

        abstract = {Humans as well as humanoid robots can use a large number of degrees of freedom to solve very complex motor tasks. The high-dimensionality of these motor tasks adds difficulties to the control problem and machine learning algorithms. However, it is well known that the intrinsic dimensionality of many human movements is small in comparison to the number of employed DoFs, and hence, the movements can be represented by a small number of synergies encoding the couplings between DoFs. In this paper, we want to apply Dimensionality Reduction (DR) to a recent movement representation used in robotics, called Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMP). While ProMP have been shown to have many benefits, they suffer with the high-dimensionality of a robotic system as the number of parameters of a ProMP scales quadratically with the dimensionality. We use probablistic dimensionality reduction techniques based on expectation maximization to extract the unknown synergies from a given set of demonstrations. The ProMP representation is now estimated in the low-dimensional space of the synergies. We show that our dimensionality reduction is more efficient both for encoding a trajectory from data and for applying Reinforcement Learning with Relative Entropy Policy Search (REPS).}

two humans assembling a box. The advantages of ProMPs in
relation to the original formulation for interaction are exposed

These approximations are typically only locally correct, which might cause instabilities in the greedy policy updates, lead to oscillations or the algorithms diverge. To overcome these drawbacks, we add a regularization term to the cost function that punishes large policy update steps in the trajectory optimization procedure. We applied this concept to the Approximate Inference Control method (AICO), where the resulting algorithm guarantees convergence for uninformative initial solutions without complex hand-tuning of learning rates. We evaluated our new algorithm on two simulated robotic platforms. A robot arm with five joints was used for reaching multiple targets while keeping the roll angle constant. On the humanoid robot Nao, we show how complex skills like reaching and balancing can be inferred from desired center of gravity or end effector coordinates.}

One fundamental problem lying in the PLSA research is the lack of a generally validated model for the complex nonlinear dynamic behaviours. In this paper, a new coefficient-adaptive orthonormal basis function model structure is specifically developed for the identification of the general PLSAs. It is a parameter-independent way directly used to identify the dynamic relation between the actuating pressures and the principal degrees of freedom of a PLSA, the bending and the steering. The approach is based on a modified auxiliary kinematic setting. Following the discussion of the identification procedure, the implementations for the double chamber bending and steering are demonstrated. The results show that the proposed approach can accurately capture the nonlinear pressure-shape dynamics. The approach is also efficient in the real-time applications. It can be further used to improve the current control design for the PLSAs in robotic applications.}

Building on this novel integrated QTC model, we propose to represent the joint spatial behaviour of a human and a robot employing a probabilistic representation based on Hidden Markov Models. We show the appropriateness of our approach by encoding different HRSI behaviours observed in a human-robot interaction study and show how the models can be used to represent and classify these behaviours using  social distance-augmented QTC.}

Abstract
Simulation in robotics is often a love-hate relationship: while simulators do save us a lot of time and effort compared to regular deployment of complex software architectures on complex hardware, simulators are also known to evade many of the real issues that robots need to manage when they enter the real world. Because humans are the paragon of dynamic, unpredictable, complex, real world entities, simulation of human-robot interactions may look condemn to fail, or, in the best case, to be mostly useless. This collective article reports on five independent applications of the MORSE simulator in the field of human-robot interaction: It appears that simulation is already useful, if not essential, to successfully carry out research in the field of HRI, and sometimes in scenarios we do not anticipate.

Research suggested that locusts use wide field visual neuron called the lobula giant movement detector to respond to imminent collisions. We employed the locusts' vision mechanism to motion control of a mobile robot. The selected image processing method is implemented on a developed extension module using a low-cost and fast ARM processor. The vision module is placed on top of a micro-robot to control its trajectory and to avoid obstacles. The observed results from several performed experiments demonstrated that the developed extension module and the inspired vision system are feasible to employ as a vision module for obstacle avoidance and motion control.}

        abstract = {Conversational systems and robots that use reinforcement learning for policy optimization in large domains often face the problem of limited scalability. This problem has been addressed either by using function approximation techniques that estimate the approximate true value function of a policy or by using a hierarchical decomposition of a learning task into subtasks. We present a novel approach for dialogue policy optimization that combines the benefits of both hierarchical control and function approximation and that allows flexible transitions between dialogue subtasks to give human users more control over the dialogue. To this end, each reinforcement learning agent in the hierarchy is extended with a subtask transition function and a dynamic state space to allow flexible switching between subdialogues. In addition, the subtask policies are represented with linear function approximation in order to generalize the decision making to situations unseen in training. Our proposed approach is evaluated in an interactive conversational robot that learns to play quiz games. Experimental results, using simulation and real users, provide evidence that our proposed approach can lead to more flexible (natural) interactions than strict hierarchical control and that it is preferred by human users.}

when contacts between objects are made or broken. A
switch of the phase can result in the robot?s actions suddenly
influencing different aspects of its environment. Therefore, the
boundaries between phases often correspond to constraints or
subgoals of the manipulation task.
In this paper, we investigate how the phases of manipulation
tasks can be learned from data. The task is modeled as an
autoregressive hidden Markov model, wherein the hidden phase
transitions depend on the observed states. The model is learned
from data using the expectation-maximization algorithm. We
demonstrate the proposed method on both a pushing task
and a pepper mill turning task. The proposed approach was
compared to a standard autoregressive hidden Markov model.
The experiments show that the learned models can accurately
predict the transitions in phases during the manipulation tasks.}

        abstract = {Many Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) approaches
rely on samples to either obtain an estimate of the
value function or a linearisation of the underlying system model.
However, these approaches typically neglect the fact that the
accuracy of the policy update depends on the closeness of the
resulting trajectory distribution to these samples. The greedy
operator does not consider such closeness constraint to the
samples. Hence, the greedy operator can lead to oscillations
or even instabilities in the policy updates. Such undesired
behaviour is likely to result in an inferior performance of the
estimated policy. We reuse inspiration from the reinforcement
learning community and relax the greedy operator used in SOC
with an information theoretic bound that limits the ?distance? of
two subsequent trajectory distributions in a policy update. The
introduced bound ensures a smooth and stable policy update.
Our method is also well suited for model-based reinforcement
learning, where we estimate the system dynamics model from
data. As this model is likely to be inaccurate, it might be
dangerous to exploit the model greedily. Instead, our bound
ensures that we generate new data in the vicinity of the current
data, such that we can improve our estimate of the system
dynamics model. We show that our approach outperforms
several state of the art approaches on challenging simulated
robot control tasks.}

        abstract = {Stochastic optimal control is typically used to plan a movement for a specific situation. Although most stochastic optimal control methods fail to generalize this movement plan to a new situation without replanning, a stochastic optimal control method is presented that allows reuse of the obtained policy in a new situation, as the policy is more robust to slight deviations from the initial movement plan. To improve the robustness of the policy, we employ information-theoretic policy updates that explicitly operate on trajectory distributions instead of single trajectories. To ensure a stable and smooth policy update, the ?distance? is limited between the trajectory distributions of the old and the new control policies. The introduced bound offers a closed-form solution for the resulting policy and extends results from recent developments in stochastic optimal control. In contrast to many standard stochastic optimal control algorithms, the current approach can directly infer the system dynamics from data points, and hence can also be used for model-based reinforcement learning.

In contrast to typical localisation approaches that rely mainly on static parts of the environment, our approach makes explicit use of information about changes by learning and modelling the spatio-temporal dynamics of the environment where the robot is acting.  The proposed spatio-temporal world model is able to predict environmental changes in time, allowing the robot to improve its localisation capabilities during long-term operations in populated environments. To investigate the proposed approach, we have enabled a mobile robot to autonomously patrol a populated environment over a period of one week while building the proposed model representation. We demonstrate that the experience learned during one week is applicable for topological localization even after a hiatus of three months by showing that the localization error rate is significantly lower compared to static environment representations.}

it with policy search. Our evaluations show that the new

This necessitates periodic reinitialisation of the simulation to reduce false positives. Using a simple obstacle avoidance controller afflicted with partial motor failure, we show that selecting the length of this reinitialisation time period is non-trivial, and that there exists a trade-off between minimising drift and the ability to detect the presence of faults.}

We start by recalling a well-known model of belief in multi-agent systems, and then, using this model,present two classes of inconsistency metrics. First, we consider metrics that attempt to characterise the overall degree of inconsistency of a multi-agent system in a single numeric value, where inconsistency is considered to be individuals within the system having contradictory beliefs. While this metric is useful as a high-level indicator of the degree of in-consistency between the beliefs of members of a multi-agent system,  it  is  of  limited  value  for  understanding  the  structure of inconsistency in a system: it gives no indication of the sources of inconsistency. We therefore introduce metrics that quantify for a given individual the extent to which that individual is in conflict with other members of the society.These metrics are based on power indices, which were developed within the cooperative game theory community in order to understand the power that individuals wield in co-operative settings.}

The image features also are not distinct enough to be used for further processing. So as to enhance these low-contrast endoscopic images a new image enhancement method based on the endoscopic images features and color distribution is proposed in this work. The enhancement method is performed on three main steps namely color space transformation, edge preserving mask formation, and histogram information correction. The luminance component of CIE Lab, YCbCr, and HSV color space is enhanced in this method and then two other components added finally to form an enhanced color image.

The design of the manipulator geometry as well as the choice of suitable material is dependent on the application, range of motion, and the suitable actuation pressure. This work describes the use of finite element analysis to simulate the range of motion of the hyperelastic response of two different soft silicones. Different geometry ratios and channel designs of the actuator are then optimized in terms of bending angle, maximum stress generated, radial expansion due to air pressure, and the amount of free area that the design allows in the actuator for other tools necessary in laparoscopic surgery.

The motivation is originated by the characteristics in the receptive field from V1. It has been proved that human or primate visual systems can distinguish useful cues from real scenes effortlessly while traditional computer vision techniques cannot accomplish this task easily. This idea motivates us to design a bio-inspired model for road extraction from remote sensing imagery. The proposed approach is an improved support vector machine (SVM) based on the pooling of feature vectors, using an improved Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel with tuning on synaptic gains. The synaptic gains comprise the feature vectors through an iterative optimization process representing the strength and width of Gaussian RBF kernel. The synaptic gains integrate the excitation and inhibition stimuli based on internal connections from V1. The summation of synaptic gains contributes to pooling of feature vectors. The experimental results verify the correlation between the synaptic gain and classification rules, and then show better performance in comparison with hidden Markov model, SVM, and fuzzy classification approaches. Our contribution is an automatic approach to road extraction without prelabeling and postprocessing work. Another apparent advantage is that our method is robust for images taken even under complex weather conditions such as snowy and foggy weather. {\^A}{\copyright} 2014 SPIE.}

It has been tested in individual and swarm scenarios and the observed results demonstrate its feasibility to be used as a micro sized mobile robot as well as a low-cost platform for robot swarm applications.}

To overcome these limitations, we propose to use 3D maps of the terrain ahead of the spraying booms based on laser range-fi?nder measurements combined with GPS-based localisation. Four different boom trajectory planning solutions which utilise the 3D maps are considered and their accuracy and real-time suitability is evaluated based on data collected from ?field tests. The point optimisation and interpolation technique presents a practical solution demonstrating satisfactory performance under real-time constraints.}

This model is used to design a robust traction control algorithm that makes use of the Sliding Mode Control (SMC), the Artificial Potential Field (APF) and a Fethi Beckoche navigation function for collision avoidance with predefined obstacles. Simulations were carried out for swarms of micro-rovers using the parameters of an in-house planetary soil simulant. The controller was designed to control the wheel movements of the robot on an unstructured environment using the SMC and APF. Simulation results show that the controller and the navigation function effectively achieves the permitted slip rate, sinkage, angular and longitudinal velocities, sliding surface and torque for the wheels, thus offering efficient traction while avoiding the excessive wheel slip and sinkage.}

Ideally, such building blocks are used in combination with a learning algorithm that is able to learn to select, adapt, sequence and co-activate the building blocks. While there has been a lot of work on approaches that support one of these requirements, no learning algorithm exists that unifies all these properties in one framework. In this paper we present our work on a unified approach for learning such a modular control architecture. We introduce new policy search algorithms that are based on information-theoretic principles and are able to learn to select, adapt and sequence the building blocks. Furthermore, we developed a new representation for the individual building block that supports co-activation and principled ways for adapting the movement. Finally, we summarize our experiments for learning modular control architectures in simulation and with real robots.}

The key idea of our paper is to mimic the human visual searching under the static and dynamic scenes. To build up an artificial vision system that performs the visual searching could be helpful to medical and psychological application development to human machine interaction. Recent state-of-the-art researches focus on the bottom-up and top-down saliency maps. Saliency maps indicate that the saliency likelihood of each pixel, however, understanding the visual searching process can help an artificial vision system exam details in a way similar to human and they will be good for future robots or machine vision systems which is a deeper digest than the saliency map. This paper proposed a computational model trying to mimic human visual searching process and we emphasis the motion cues on the visual processing and searching. Our model analysis the attention shifts by fusing the top-down bias and bottom-up cues. This model also takes account the motion factor into the visual searching processing. The proposed model involves five modules: the pre-learning process; top-down biasing; bottom-up mechanism; multi-layer neural network and attention shifts. Experiment evaluation results via benchmark databases and real-time video showed the model demonstrated high robustness and real-time ability under complex dynamic scenes.}

primitives build on the framework of dynamic motor primitives

the DMP. With this distribution, we can learn the inherent

In this talk, we present a novel approach for long-term representation of populated environments, where many of the observed changes are caused by humans performing their daily activities. We propose to model the environment's dynamics by its frequency spectrum, as a combination of harmonic functions that correspond to periodic processes influencing the environment. Such a representation not only allows representation of environment dynamics over arbitrary timescales with constant memory requirements, but also prediction of future environment states. The proposed approach can be applied to many of the state-of-the-art environment models. In particular, we show that occupancy grids, topological or landmark maps can be easily extended to represent dynamic environments. We present experiments using data collected by a mobile robot patrolling an indoor environment over a period of one month, where frequency-enhanced models were compared to their static counterparts in four scenarios: i) 3D map building, ii) environment state prediction, iii) topological localisation and iv) anomaly detection, in order to verify the model's ability to detect unusual events. In all these cases, the frequency-enhanced models outperformed their static counterparts.}

Aggregation can be classified as cue-based or self-organized.

In this paper, we proposed a novel fuzzy-based method for cue-based aggregation based on the state-of-the-art BEECLUST algorithm. In particular, we proposed three different methods: na{\"i}ve, that uses a deterministic decision-making mechanism; vector-averaging, using a vectorial summation of all perceived inputs; and fuzzy, that uses a fuzzy logic controller. We used different experiment settings: one-source and two-source environments with static and dynamic conditions to compare all the methods. We observed that the fuzzy method outperformed all the other methods and it is the most robust method against noise.}

So far, the environment models used in mobile robotics have been tailored to capture static scenes and dealt with the environment changes by means of ?memory decay?. While these models keep up with slowly changing environments, their utilization in dynamic, real world
environments is difficult.

The representation proposed in this paper models the environment?s spatio-temporal dynamics by its frequency spectrum. The spectral representation of the time domain allows to identify, analyse and remember regularly occurring environment processes in a computationally efficient way. Knowledge of the periodicity of the different environment processes constitutes the model predictive capabilities, which are especially useful for long-term mobile robotics scenarios.

In the experiments presented, the proposed approach is applied to data collected by a mobile robot patrolling an indoor
environment over a period of one week. Three scenarios are investigated, including intruder detection and 4D mapping. The results indicate that the proposed method allows to represent arbitrary timescales with constant (and low) memory requirements, achieving compression rates up to 106 . Moreover, the representation allows for prediction of future environment?s state with {$\sim$} 90\% precision.}

In this paper we present a novel approach for situated Natural Language Generation in dialogue that is based on hierarchical reinforcement learning and learns the best utterance for a context by optimisation through trial and error. The model is trained from human?human corpus data and learns particularly to balance the trade-off between efficiency and detail in giving instructions: the user needs to be given sufficient information to execute their task, but without exceeding their cognitive load. We present results from simulation and a task-based human evaluation study comparing two different versions of hierarchical reinforcement learning: One operates using a hierarchy of policies with a large state space and local knowledge, and the other additionally shares knowledge across generation subtasks to enhance performance. Results show that sharing knowledge across subtasks achieves better performance than learning in isolation, leading to smoother and more successful interactions that are better perceived by human users.}

Learning objectives were identified for eleven pupils with PMD and a humanoid robot was programmed to enable teachers to use it to help pupils achieve these objectives. These changes were evaluated with a series of eleven case studies where teacher-pupil dyads were observed during four planned video recorded sessions. Engagement was rated in a classroom setting and during the last session with the robot. Video recordings were analysed for duration of engagement and teacher assistance and number of goals achieved. Rated engagement was significantly higher with the robot than in the classroom. Observations of engagement, assistance and goal achievement remained at the same level throughout the sessions suggesting no reduction in the novelty factor.}

        abstract = {The motivation for this research stems from the future vision of being able to buy a mobile service robot for your own household, unpack it, switch it on, and have it behave in an intelligent way; but of course it also has to adapt to your personal preferences over time. My work is focusing on the spatial aspect of the robot?s behaviours, which means when it is moving in a confined, shared space with a human it will also take the communicative character of these movements into account. This adaptation to the users preferences should come from experience which the robot gathers throughout several days or months of interaction and not from a programmer hard-coding certain behaviours}

        abstract = {Policy evaluation is an essential step in most reinforcement learning approaches. It yields a value function, the quality assessment of states for a given policy, which can be used in a policy improvement step. Since the late 1980s, this research area has been dominated by temporal-difference (TD) methods due to their data-efficiency. However, core issues such as stability guarantees in the off-policy scenario, improved sample efficiency and probabilistic treatment of the uncertainty in the estimates have only been tackled recently, which has led to a large number of new approaches.

This paper aims at making these new developments accessible in a concise overview, with foci on underlying cost functions, the off-policy scenario as well as on regularization in high dimensional feature spaces. By presenting the first extensive, systematic comparative evaluations comparing TD, LSTD, LSPE, FPKF, the residual- gradient algorithm, Bellman residual minimization, GTD, GTD2 and TDC, we shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the methods. Moreover, we present alternative versions of LSTD and LSPE with drastically improved off-policy performance.}

        abstract = {Spatial interactions between agents carry information of high value to human observers, as exemplified by the high-level interpretations that humans make when watching the Heider and Simmel movie, or other such videos which just contain motions of simple objects, such as points, lines and triangles. However, not all the information contained in a pair of continuous trajectories is important; and thus the need for qualitative descriptions of interaction trajectories arises. Towards that purpose, Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) has been proposed in (Van de Weghe, 2004). However, the original definition of QTC handles uncorrupted continuous-time trajectories, while real-world signals are noisy and sampled in discrete-time. Also, although QTC presents a method for transforming trajectories to qualitative descriptions, the inverse problem has not yet been studied. Thus, in this paper, after discussing several aspects of the transition from ideal QTC to discrete-time noisy QTC, we introduce a novel algorithm for solving the QTC inverse problem; i.e. transforming qualitative descriptions to archetypal trajectories that satisfy them. Both of these problems are particularly important for the successful application of qualitative trajectory calculus to Human-Robot Interaction.}

This paper applies ideas from the developing study of granular materials together with a detailed characterization of the sinkage process to propose and validate a combined model of terrain interaction based on an understanding of the physics and micro mechanics at the granular level. Whilst the model reflects the complexity of interactions expected from a walking rover, common themes emerge which enable the model to be streamlined to the extent that a simple mathematical representation is possible without resorting to numerical methods. Bespoke testing and analysis tools are described which reveal some unexpected conclusions and point the way towards intelligent control and foot geometry techniques to improve thrust generation.}

Such proposed AIS executes orderly three modules-danger detection, immune evolution and memory update. The first module identifies whether there are changes in the optimization environment and decides the environmental level, which helps for creating the initial population in the environment and promoting the process of solution search. The second module runs a loop of optimization, in which three sub-populations each with a dynamic size seek simultaneously the location of the optimal solution along different directions through co-evolution. The last module stores and updates the memory cells which help the first module decide the environmental level. This optimization system is an on-line and adaptive one with the characteristics of simplicity, modularization and co-evolution. The numerical experiments and the results acquired by the nonparametric statistic procedures, based on 22 benchmark problems and an engineering problem, show that the proposed approach performs globally well over the compared algorithms and is of potential use for many kinds of dynamic optimization problems. {\^A}{\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.}

Focus will be placed on the latter type of locomotion to demonstrate, through model simulations and experimental trials, that the robot?s speed increases by about 3 times compared to crawling. This finding is coherent with the performances of the biological counterpart when adopting this gait. Specific features of underwater legged locomotion are then derived from the model, which prompt the possibility of controlling locomotion by using simple control and by exploiting slight morphological adaptations.}

        abstract = {Path integral (PI) control defines a general class of control problems for which the optimal control computation is equivalent to an inference problem that can be solved by evaluation of a path integral over state trajectories. However, this potential is mostly unused in real-world problems because of two main limitations: first, current approaches can typically only be applied to learn open-loop controllers and second, current sampling procedures are inefficient and not scalable to high dimensional systems. We introduce the efficient Path Integral Relative-Entropy Policy Search (PI-REPS) algorithm for learning feedback policies with PI control. Our algorithm is inspired by information theoretic policy updates that are often used in policy search. We use these updates to approximate the state trajectory distribution that is known to be optimal from the PI control theory. Our approach allows for a principled treatment of different sampling distributions and can be used to estimate many types of parametric or non-parametric feedback controllers. We show that PI-REPS significantly outperforms current methods and is able to solve tasks that are out of reach for current methods.}

However, the former one simply considers the average pattern within the class, and the latter one just relies on the nearest relevant single pattern. In this paper, a novel learning rule and its SNN framework has been proposed. It considers all relevant patterns in the local domain around the undetermined sample rather than just nearest relevant single pattern. Experimental results show the proposed learning rule and its SNN framework obtains satisfactory testing results under the ORL face database.}

Though these summation techniques when modelled are effective in improving the quality of low light images, using the temporal summation in scenes where image velocity is high only come at a cost of motion blurring in the output scenes. Most recent research has been towards reducing motion blurring in scenes where motion is caused by moving objects rather than effectively reducing motion blurring in scenes where motion is caused by moving cameras. This makes it impossible to implement the night vision algorithm in moving robots or cars that operate under low light conditions. In this paper we present a generic new method that can replace the normal temporal summation in scenes where motion is detected. The proposed method is both suitable for motion caused by moving objects as well as moving cameras. The effectiveness of this new generic method is shown with relevant supporting experiments.}
