        abstract = {Most multi-robot task allocation algorithms are concerned with the allocation of individual tasks to single robots. However certain types of tasks require a team of robots for their execution, and for the allocation of such tasks non-conflicting robot teams have to be formed. Most of the existing allocation algorithms for such tasks mainly address the robot-team formation and the tasks are allocated sequentially. However, allocating multiple tasks simultaneously will result in a more balanced distribution of robots into teams. A market based algorithm for simultaneous allocation of multiple tightly couple multi-robot tasks to coalitions of heterogeneous robots are proposed in this paper. The simultaneous allocations are deadlock-free and significant improvement in overall execution time is achieved as demonstrated by empirical evaluations.}

        abstract = {Current approaches to networked robot systems (or ecology of robots and sensors) in ambient assisted living applications (AAL) rely on pre-programmed models of the environment and do not evolve to address novel states of the environment. Envisaged as part of a robotic ecology in an AAL environment to provide different services based on the events and user activities, a Markov based approach to establishing a user behavioural model through the use of a cognitive memory module is presented in this paper. Upon detecting changes in the normal user behavioural pattern, the ecology tries to adapt its response to these changes in an intelligent manner. The approach is evaluated with physical robots and an experimental evaluation is presented in this paper. A major challenge associated with data storage in a sensor rich environment is the expanding memory requirements. In order to address this, a bio-inspired data retention strategy is also proposed. These contributions can enable a robotic ecology to adapt to evolving environmental states while efficiently managing the memory footprint.}

With off-the-shelf computational equipment and low-cost cameras, the core algorithm is able to process hundreds of images per second while tracking hundreds of objects with a millimeter precision. In addition, we present the method's mathematical model, which allows to estimate the expected localization precision, area of coverage, and processing speed from the camera's intrinsic parameters and hardware's processing capacity. The correctness of the presented model and performance of the algorithm in real-world conditions is verified in several experiments.

Numerous parameters such as the member shapes and sizes, the elasticity modulus of material, the locations of nodes and the support constraints can be selected as design variables. These variables are progressively revised in order to obtain a satisfactory structure. Each modification requires a fresh analysis for the displacements and stresses, and reanalysis can be employed to reduce the computational cost. This paper is focused on static reanalysis problem with modification of deleting some supports. An efficient reanalysis method is proposed. The method makes full use of the initial information and preserves the ease of implementation. Numerical examples show that the calculated results of the proposed method are the identical as those of the direct analysis, while the computational time is remarkably reduced.}

By combining two variants of QTC that implement different resolutions and switching between them based on distance thresholds we show that we are able to both reduce the complexity of the representation and at the same time enrich QTC with one of the core HRSI concepts: proxemics. Building on this novel integrated QTC model, we propose to represent the joint spatial behaviour of a human and a robot employing a probabilistic representation based on Hidden Markov Models. We show the appropriateness of our approach by encoding different HRSI behaviours observed in a human-robot interaction study and show how the models can be used to represent and classify these behaviours using  social distance-augmented QTC.}

Abstract
Simulation in robotics is often a love-hate relationship: while simulators do save us a lot of time and effort compared to regular deployment of complex software architectures on complex hardware, simulators are also known to evade many of the real issues that robots need to manage when they enter the real world. Because humans are the paragon of dynamic, unpredictable, complex, real world entities, simulation of human-robot interactions may look condemn to fail, or, in the best case, to be mostly useless. This collective article reports on five independent applications of the MORSE simulator in the field of human-robot interaction: It appears that simulation is already useful, if not essential, to successfully carry out research in the field of HRI, and sometimes in scenarios we do not anticipate.

The processing method takes inspiration from vision of locusts in detecting the fast approaching objects. Research suggested that locusts use wide field visual neuron called the lobula giant movement detector to respond to imminent collisions. We employed the locusts' vision mechanism to motion control of a mobile robot. The selected image processing method is implemented on a developed extension module using a low-cost and fast ARM processor. The vision module is placed on top of a micro-robot to control its trajectory and to avoid obstacles. The observed results from several performed experiments demonstrated that the developed extension module and the inspired vision system are feasible to employ as a vision module for obstacle avoidance and motion control.}

Machine learning provides interactive systems with opportunities to improve performance not only of individual components but also of the system as a whole. However, machine learning methods that encompass multiple modalities of an interactive system are still relatively hard to find.

        abstract = {Conversational systems and robots that use reinforcement learning for policy optimization in large domains often face the problem of limited scalability. This problem has been addressed either by using function approximation techniques that estimate the approximate true value function of a policy or by using a hierarchical decomposition of a learning task into subtasks. We present a novel approach for dialogue policy optimization that combines the benefits of both hierarchical control and function approximation and that allows flexible transitions between dialogue subtasks to give human users more control over the dialogue. To this end, each reinforcement learning agent in the hierarchy is extended with a subtask transition function and a dynamic state space to allow flexible switching between subdialogues. In addition, the subtask policies are represented with linear function approximation in order to generalize the decision making to situations unseen in training. Our proposed approach is evaluated in an interactive conversational robot that learns to play quiz games. Experimental results, using simulation and real users, provide evidence that our proposed approach can lead to more flexible (natural) interactions than strict hierarchical control and that it is preferred by human users.}

In contrast to typical localisation approaches that rely mainly on static parts of the environment, our approach makes explicit use of information about changes by learning and modelling the spatio-temporal dynamics of the environment where the robot is acting.  The proposed spatio-temporal world model is able to predict environmental changes in time, allowing the robot to improve its localisation capabilities during long-term operations in populated environments. To investigate the proposed approach, we have enabled a mobile robot to autonomously patrol a populated environment over a period of one week while building the proposed model representation. We demonstrate that the experience learned during one week is applicable for topological localization even after a hiatus of three months by showing that the localization error rate is significantly lower compared to static environment representations.}

We start by recalling a well-known model of belief in multi-agent systems, and then, using this model,present two classes of inconsistency metrics. First, we consider metrics that attempt to characterise the overall degree of inconsistency of a multi-agent system in a single numeric value, where inconsistency is considered to be individuals within the system having contradictory beliefs. While this metric is useful as a high-level indicator of the degree of in-consistency between the beliefs of members of a multi-agent system,  it  is  of  limited  value  for  understanding  the  structure of inconsistency in a system: it gives no indication of the sources of inconsistency. We therefore introduce metrics that quantify for a given individual the extent to which that individual is in conflict with other members of the society.These metrics are based on power indices, which were developed within the cooperative game theory community in order to understand the power that individuals wield in co-operative settings.}

But still the quality of images from this new wireless endoscopy system is not satisfactory. It's hard for doctors and specialist to easily examine and interpret the captured images. The image features also are not distinct enough to be used for further processing. So as to enhance these low-contrast endoscopic images a new image enhancement method based on the endoscopic images features and color distribution is proposed in this work. The enhancement method is performed on three main steps namely color space transformation, edge preserving mask formation, and histogram information correction. The luminance component of CIE Lab, YCbCr, and HSV color space is enhanced in this method and then two other components added finally to form an enhanced color image. The experimental result clearly show the robustness of the method. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.}

        abstract = {An adaptive approach for road extraction inspired by the mechanism of primary visual cortex (V1) is proposed. The motivation is originated by the characteristics in the receptive field from V1. It has been proved that human or primate visual systems can distinguish useful cues from real scenes effortlessly while traditional computer vision techniques cannot accomplish this task easily. This idea motivates us to design a bio-inspired model for road extraction from remote sensing imagery. The proposed approach is an improved support vector machine (SVM) based on the pooling of feature vectors, using an improved Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel with tuning on synaptic gains. The synaptic gains comprise the feature vectors through an iterative optimization process representing the strength and width of Gaussian RBF kernel. The synaptic gains integrate the excitation and inhibition stimuli based on internal connections from V1. The summation of synaptic gains contributes to pooling of feature vectors. The experimental results verify the correlation between the synaptic gain and classification rules, and then show better performance in comparison with hidden Markov model, SVM, and fuzzy classification approaches. Our contribution is an automatic approach to road extraction without prelabeling and postprocessing work. Another apparent advantage is that our method is robust for images taken even under complex weather conditions such as snowy and foggy weather. {\^A}{\copyright} 2014 SPIE.}

The key idea of our paper is to mimic the human visual searching under the static and dynamic scenes. To build up an artificial vision system that performs the visual searching could be helpful to medical and psychological application development to human machine interaction. Recent state-of-the-art researches focus on the bottom-up and top-down saliency maps. Saliency maps indicate that the saliency likelihood of each pixel, however, understanding the visual searching process can help an artificial vision system exam details in a way similar to human and they will be good for future robots or machine vision systems which is a deeper digest than the saliency map. This paper proposed a computational model trying to mimic human visual searching process and we emphasis the motion cues on the visual processing and searching. Our model analysis the attention shifts by fusing the top-down bias and bottom-up cues. This model also takes account the motion factor into the visual searching processing. The proposed model involves five modules: the pre-learning process; top-down biasing; bottom-up mechanism; multi-layer neural network and attention shifts. Experiment evaluation results via benchmark databases and real-time video showed the model demonstrated high robustness and real-time ability under complex dynamic scenes.}

In this talk, we present a novel approach for long-term representation of populated environments, where many of the observed changes are caused by humans performing their daily activities. We propose to model the environment's dynamics by its frequency spectrum, as a combination of harmonic functions that correspond to periodic processes influencing the environment. Such a representation not only allows representation of environment dynamics over arbitrary timescales with constant memory requirements, but also prediction of future environment states. The proposed approach can be applied to many of the state-of-the-art environment models. In particular, we show that occupancy grids, topological or landmark maps can be easily extended to represent dynamic environments. We present experiments using data collected by a mobile robot patrolling an indoor environment over a period of one month, where frequency-enhanced models were compared to their static counterparts in four scenarios: i) 3D map building, ii) environment state prediction, iii) topological localisation and iv) anomaly detection, in order to verify the model's ability to detect unusual events. In all these cases, the frequency-enhanced models outperformed their static counterparts.}

In this paper, we proposed a novel fuzzy-based method for cue-based aggregation based on the state-of-the-art BEECLUST algorithm. In particular, we proposed three different methods: na{\"i}ve, that uses a deterministic decision-making mechanism; vector-averaging, using a vectorial summation of all perceived inputs; and fuzzy, that uses a fuzzy logic controller. We used different experiment settings: one-source and two-source environments with static and dynamic conditions to compare all the methods. We observed that the fuzzy method outperformed all the other methods and it is the most robust method against noise.}

So far, the environment models used in mobile robotics have been tailored to capture static scenes and dealt with the environment changes by means of ?memory decay?. While these models keep up with slowly changing environments, their utilization in dynamic, real world
environments is difficult.

The representation proposed in this paper models the environment?s spatio-temporal dynamics by its frequency spectrum. The spectral representation of the time domain allows to identify, analyse and remember regularly occurring environment processes in a computationally efficient way. Knowledge of the periodicity of the different environment processes constitutes the model predictive capabilities, which are especially useful for long-term mobile robotics scenarios.

In the experiments presented, the proposed approach is applied to data collected by a mobile robot patrolling an indoor
environment over a period of one week. Three scenarios are investigated, including intruder detection and 4D mapping. The results indicate that the proposed method allows to represent arbitrary timescales with constant (and low) memory requirements, achieving compression rates up to 106 . Moreover, the representation allows for prediction of future environment?s state with {$\sim$} 90\% precision.}

In this paper we present a novel approach for situated Natural Language Generation in dialogue that is based on hierarchical reinforcement learning and learns the best utterance for a context by optimisation through trial and error. The model is trained from human?human corpus data and learns particularly to balance the trade-off between efficiency and detail in giving instructions: the user needs to be given sufficient information to execute their task, but without exceeding their cognitive load. We present results from simulation and a task-based human evaluation study comparing two different versions of hierarchical reinforcement learning: One operates using a hierarchy of policies with a large state space and local knowledge, and the other additionally shares knowledge across generation subtasks to enhance performance. Results show that sharing knowledge across subtasks achieves better performance than learning in isolation, leading to smoother and more successful interactions that are better perceived by human users.}

However, not all the information contained in a pair of continuous trajectories is important; and thus the need for qualitative descriptions of interaction trajectories arises. Towards that purpose, Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) has been proposed in (Van de Weghe, 2004). However, the original definition of QTC handles uncorrupted continuous-time trajectories, while real-world signals are noisy and sampled in discrete-time. Also, although QTC presents a method for transforming trajectories to qualitative descriptions, the inverse problem has not yet been studied. Thus, in this paper, after discussing several aspects of the transition from ideal QTC to discrete-time noisy QTC, we introduce a novel algorithm for solving the QTC inverse problem; i.e. transforming qualitative descriptions to archetypal trajectories that satisfy them. Both of these problems are particularly important for the successful application of qualitative trajectory calculus to Human-Robot Interaction.}

        abstract = {In this paper, we propose an artificial immune system (AIS) based on the danger theory in immunology for solving dynamic nonlinear constrained single-objective optimization problems with time-dependent design spaces. Such proposed AIS executes orderly three modules-danger detection, immune evolution and memory update. The first module identifies whether there are changes in the optimization environment and decides the environmental level, which helps for creating the initial population in the environment and promoting the process of solution search. The second module runs a loop of optimization, in which three sub-populations each with a dynamic size seek simultaneously the location of the optimal solution along different directions through co-evolution. The last module stores and updates the memory cells which help the first module decide the environmental level. This optimization system is an on-line and adaptive one with the characteristics of simplicity, modularization and co-evolution. The numerical experiments and the results acquired by the nonparametric statistic procedures, based on 22 benchmark problems and an engineering problem, show that the proposed approach performs globally well over the compared algorithms and is of potential use for many kinds of dynamic optimization problems. {\^A}{\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.}

Focus will be placed on the latter type of locomotion to demonstrate, through model simulations and experimental trials, that the robot?s speed increases by about 3 times compared to crawling. This finding is coherent with the performances of the biological counterpart when adopting this gait. Specific features of underwater legged locomotion are then derived from the model, which prompt the possibility of controlling locomotion by using simple control and by exploiting slight morphological adaptations.}

        abstract = {Most of visual pattern recognition algorithms try to emulate the mechanism of visual pathway within the human brain. Regarding of classic face recognition task, by using the spatiotemporal information extracted from Spiking neural network (SNN), batch learning rule and on-line learning rule stand out from their competitors. However, the former one simply considers the average pattern within the class, and the latter one just relies on the nearest relevant single pattern. In this paper, a novel learning rule and its SNN framework has been proposed. It considers all relevant patterns in the local domain around the undetermined sample rather than just nearest relevant single pattern. Experimental results show the proposed learning rule and its SNN framework obtains satisfactory testing results under the ORL face database.}

        abstract = {In order to see under low light conditions nocturnal insects rely on neural strategies based on combinations of spatial and temporal summations. Though these summation techniques when modelled are effective in improving the quality of low light images, using the temporal summation in scenes where image velocity is high only come at a cost of motion blurring in the output scenes. Most recent research has been towards reducing motion blurring in scenes where motion is caused by moving objects rather than effectively reducing motion blurring in scenes where motion is caused by moving cameras. This makes it impossible to implement the night vision algorithm in moving robots or cars that operate under low light conditions. In this paper we present a generic new method that can replace the normal temporal summation in scenes where motion is detected. The proposed method is both suitable for motion caused by moving objects as well as moving cameras. The effectiveness of this new generic method is shown with relevant supporting experiments.}
