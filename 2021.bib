        abstract = {Memory, the process of encoding, storing, and maintaining information over time in order to influence future actions, is very important in our lives. Losing it, it comes with a great cost. Deciphering the biophysical mechanisms leading to recall improvement should thus be of outmost importance. In this study we embarked on the quest to improve computationally the recall performance of a bio-inspired microcircuit model of the mammalian hippocampus, a brain region responsible for the storage and recall of short-term declarative memories. The model consisted of excitatory and inhibitory cells. The cell properties followed closely what is currently known from the experimental neurosciences. Cells? firing was timed to a theta oscillation paced by two distinct neuronal populations exhibiting highly regular bursting activity, one tightly coupled to the trough and the other to the peak of theta. An excitatory input provided to excitatory cells context and timing information for retrieval of previously stored memory patterns. Inhibition to excitatory cells acted as a non-specific global threshold machine that removed spurious activity during recall. To systematically evaluate the model?s recall performance against stored patterns, pattern overlap, network size and active cells per pattern, we selectively modulated feedforward and feedback excitatory and inhibitory pathways targeting specific excitatory and inhibitory cells. Of the different model variations (modulated pathways) tested, ?model 1? recall quality was excellent across all conditions. ?Model 2? recall was the worst. The number of ?active cells? representing a memory pattern was the determining factor in improving the model?s recall performance regardless of the number of stored patterns and overlap between them. As ?active cells per pattern? decreased, the model?s memory capacity increased, interference effects between stored patterns decreased, and recall quality improved.}

It is commonly integrated with the greenhouse environmental control system for optimally controlling environmental parameters to maximize the tomato growth/yields under acceptable energy consumption. In this work, we compare three mainstream evolutionary algorithms (genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolutionary (DE)) for calibrating the reduced Tomgro model, to model the tomato mature fruit dry matter (DM) weights. Different evolutionary algorithms have been applied to calibrate 14 key parameters of the reduced Tomgro model. And the performance of the calibrated Tomgro models based on different evolutionary algorithms has been evaluated based on three datasets obtained from a real tomato grower, with each dataset containing greenhouse environmental parameters (e.g., carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)) and tomato yield information at a particular greenhouse for one year. Multiple metrics (root mean square errors (RMSEs), relative root mean square errors (r-RSMEs), and mean average errors (MAEs)) between actual DM weights and model-simulated ones for all three datasets, are used to validate the performance of calibrated reduced Tomgro model.}

The complex nature of today?s needs requires groups of things, and not separate things, to work together to satisfy these needs. By analogy with other ICTs like Web services, thing composition is specified with a model that uses dependencies to decide upon things that will do what, where, when, and why. Two types of dependencies are adopted, regular that schedule the execution chronology of things and special that coordinate the operations of things when they run into obstacles like unavailability of resources to use. Both resource use and resource availability are specified in compliance with Allen?s time intervals upon which reasoning takes place.

However, to date, no systematic reviews of qualitative studies exploring the end-user experiences of robotic devices in motor rehabilitation have been published. The aim of this study was to review end-users? (patients, carers and healthcare professionals) experiences with robotic devices in motor rehabilitation, by conducting a systematic review and thematic meta-synthesis of qualitative studies concerning the users? experiences with such robotic devices.
Methods: Qualitative studies and mixed-methods studies with a qualitative element were eligible for inclusion.  Nine electronic databases were searched from inception to August 2020, supplemented with internet searches and forward and backward citation tracking from the included studies and review articles. Data were synthesised thematically following the Thomas and Harden approach. The CASP Qualitative Checklist was used to assess the quality of the included studies of this review.
Results: The search strategy identified a total of 13,556 citations and after removing duplicates and excluding citations based on title and abstract, and full text screening, 30 studies were included. All studies were considered of acceptable quality. We developed six analytical themes: logistic barriers; technological challenges; appeal and engagement; supportive interactions and relationships; benefits for physical, psychological, and social function(ing); and expanding and sustaining therapeutic options.
Conclusions: Despite experiencing technological and logistic challenges, participants found robotic devices acceptable, useful and beneficial (physically, psychologically, and socially), as well as fun and interesting. Having supportive relationships with significant others and positive therapeutic relationships with healthcare staff were considered the foundation for successful rehabilitation and recovery.}

advancing, and there is a growing appetite for developing cost-effective RAS solutions
for in situ servicing, debris removal, manufacturing, and assembly missions. An orbital
space robot, that is, a spacecraft mounted with one or more robotic manipulators, is an
inevitable system for a range of future in-orbit services. However, various practical
challenges make controlling a space robot extremely difficult compared with its
terrestrial counterpart. The state of the art of modeling the kinematics and dynamics of
a space robot, operating in the free-flying and free-floating modes, has been well studied
by researchers. However, these two modes of operation have various shortcomings,
which can be overcome by operating the space robot in the controlled-floating mode. This
tutorial article aims to address the knowledge gap in modeling complex space robots
operating in the controlled-floating mode and under perturbed conditions. The novel
research contribution of this article is the refined dynamic model of a chaser space robot,
derived with respect to the moving target while accounting for the internal perturbations
due to constantly changing the center of mass, the inertial matrix, Coriolis, and centrifugal
terms of the coupled system; it also accounts for the external environmental disturbances.
The nonlinear model presented accurately represents the multibody coupled dynamics of
a space robot, which is pivotal for precise pose control. Simulation results presented
demonstrate the accuracy of the model for closed-loop control. In addition to the
theoretical contributions in mathematical modeling, this article also offers a
commercially viable solution for a wide range of in-orbit missions.}

However, the available LfD are lacking the modelling of the manipulation path/trajectory as an explicit function of the visual sensory information. This paper presents a novel approach to manipulation path/trajectory planning called deep Movement Primitives that successfully generates the movements of a manipulator to reach a breast phantom and perform the palpation.

In this work, we combine text dialogue history representations generated by a GPT-2 model with audio embeddings obtained by the recently released Wav2Vec2 transformer model. We jointly fine-tune these models to learn dialogue policies via supervised learning and two policy gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithms. Our experimental results, using the DSTC2 dataset and a simulated user model capable of sampling audio turns, reveal that audio embeddings lead to overall higher task success (than without using audio embeddings) with statistically significant results across evaluation metrics and training algorithms.}

Planning AV actions in the presence of pedestrians thus requires modelling of their probable future behaviour as well as detecting and tracking them. This narrative review article is Part I of a pair, together surveying the current technology stack involved in this process, organising recent research into a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from low-level image detection to high-level psychology models, from the perspective of an AV designer. This self-contained Part I covers the lower levels of this stack, from sensing, through detection and recognition, up to tracking of pedestrians. Technologies at these levels are found to be mature and available as foundations for use in high-level systems, such as behaviour modelling, prediction and interaction control.}

We train a PointNet++ variant on a fully annotated procedurally generated data set of partial point clouds of tomato plants, and show that the network is capable of distinguishing between the semantic classes of leaves, stems, and soil based on structural data only. We present both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results, and establish a proof of concept, indicating that deep learning is a promising approach towards replacing the current complex, laborious, species-specific, state-of-the-art plant segmentation procedures.}

        abstract = {Multi-robot system is an ever growing tool which is able to be applied to a wide range of industries to improve productivity and robustness, especially when tasks are distributed in space, time and functionality. Recent works have shown the benefits of multi-robot systems in fields such as warehouse automation, entertainment and agriculture. The work presented in this paper tackles the deadlock problem in multi-robot navigation, in which robots within a common work-space, are caught in situations where they are unable to navigate to their targets, being blocked by one another. This problem can be mitigated by efficient multi-robot path planning. Our work focused around the development of a scalable rescheduling algorithm named Conflict Resolution Heuristic A* (CRH*) for decoupled prioritised planning. Extensive experimental evaluation of CRH* was carried out in discrete event simulations of a fleet of autonomous agricultural robots. The results from these experiments proved that the algorithm was both scalable and deadlock-free. Additionally, novel customisation options were included to test further optimisations in system performance. Continuous Assignment and Dynamic Scoring showed to reduce the make-span of the routing whilst Combinatorial Heuristics showed to reduce the impact of outliers on priority orderings.}

Elucidating the underlying physiology of such capability could potentially address numerous challenging problems in flight engineering. This study investigates the aerodynamic characteristics of an insect species called desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) with an extraordinary gliding skills at low Reynolds number. Here, locust tandem wings are subjected to a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using 2D and 3D Navier-Stokes equations revealing fore-hindwing interactions, and the influence of their corrugations on the aerodynamic performance. Furthermore, the obtained CFD results are mathematically parameterized using PARSEC method and optimized based on a novel fusion of Genetic Algorithms and Nash game theory to achieve Nash equilibrium being the optimized wings.
It was concluded that the lift-drag (gliding) ratio of the optimized profiles were improved by at least 77\% and 150\% compared to the original wing and the published literature, respectively.
Ultimately, the profiles are integrated and analyzed using 3D CFD simulations that demonstrated a 14\% performance improvement validating the proposed wing models for further fabrication and rapid prototyping presented in the future study.}

Results of different combination of input sources are presented, with an overall mean accuracy of 95\% (std: 7\%) for predicting when the artist is present and 68\% (std: 15\%) for predicting when the artist is drawing; and mean squared normalised error of 0.0034 (std: 0.0099) of predicting the pen?s position on the drawing canvas. These results point toward an autonomous robotic system having an awareness of an artist at work via camera based input and contributes toward the development of a more fluid physical to digital workflow for creative content creation.}

Detecting and localizing humans reliably and accurately in such an environment, however, is a prerequisite to many  services offered by fleets of mobile robots collaborating with human workers. Consequently, in this paper, we expand on the concept of a topological particle filter (TPF) to accurately and individually localize and track workers in a farm environment, integrating information from heterogeneous sensors and combining local active sensing (exploiting a robot?s onboard sensing employing a Next-Best-Sense planning approach) and global localization (using affordable IoT GNSS devices). We validate the proposed approach in topologies created for the deployment of robotics fleets to support fruit pickers in a real farm environment. By combining multi-sensor observations on the topological level complemented by active perception through the NBS approach, we show that we can improve the accuracy of picker localization in comparison to prior work.}

Reducing time for this travel can greatly reduce the global task completion time and improve the availability of the robot to perform more number of tasks. Looking at in-field logistics robots for supporting human fruit pickers as a relevant scenario, this research deals with the design of various algorithms for automated allocation of parking spaces for the on-field robots, so as to make them most accessible to preferred areas of the field. These parking space allocation algorithms are tested
for their performance by varying initial parameters like the size of the field, number of farm workers in the field, position of the farm workers etc. Various experiments are conducted for this purpose on a simulated environment. Their results are studied and discussed for better understanding about the contribution of intelligent parking space allocation towards improving the overall time efficiency of task completion.}

Knowledge of the mechanical properties of the objects in their immediate surroundings, however, could bring huge benefits to applications such as path planning, obstacle avoidance \& removal or estimating object compliance.
In this paper, we present a novel approach to inferring mechanical properties of dynamic objects with the help of active perception and frequency analysis of objects' stimulus responses. We perform FFT on a buffer of image flow maps to identify the spectral signature of objects and from that their eigenfrequency. Combining this with 3D depth information allows us to infer an object's mass without having to weigh it.
We perform experiments on a demonstrator with variable mass and stiffness to test our approach and provide an analysis on the influence of individual properties on the result. By simply applying a controlled amount of force to a system, we were able to infer mechanical properties of systems with an eigenfrequency of around 4.5 Hz in about 2 s. This lab-based feasibility study opens new exciting robotic applications targeting realistic, non-rigid objects such as plants, crops or fabric.}

improvement in spatial interpolation by using the prediction uncertainty of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) as ?attraction force? to deployed robots in path planning. Although the integration with Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solvers was also shown to produce relatively short travel distance, we here hypothesise several factors that could decrease the overall prediction precision as well because sub-optimal locations may eventually be included in their paths. To address this issue, in this paper, we first explore ?local planning? approaches adopting various spatial ranges within which next sampling locations are prioritized to investigate their effects on the prediction performance as well as incurred travel distance. Also, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based high-level controllers are trained to adaptively produce blended plans from a particular set of local planners to inherit unique strengths from that selection depending on latest prediction states. Our experiments on use cases of temperature monitoring robots demonstrate that the dynamic mixtures of planners can not only generate sophisticated, informative plans that a single planner could
not create alone but also ensure significantly reduced travel distances at no cost of prediction reliability without any assist of additional modules for shortest path calculation.}

We have built a controllable dynamic visual environment based on our previously developed ColCOS\${$\backslash$}Phi\$ (a multi-pheromones platform) by enclosing the arena with LED panels and interacting with the micro mobile robots with a visual sensor.

harvester needs to be aware of the full poses of the crop/fruit to be collected in order to perform proper path- and collision planning. The current state of the art mainly considers problems of detection and segmentation of fruit with localisation limited to the 3D position only. The reliable and real-time estimation of the respective orientations remains a mostly unaddressed problem. In this paper, we present a compact and efficient network architecture for estimating the orientation of soft fruit such as strawberries from colour and, optionally, depth images. The proposed system can be automatically trained in a realistic simulation environment. We evaluate the system?s performance on simulated datasets and validate its operation on publicly available images of strawberries to demonstrate its practical use. Depending on the amount of training data used, coverage of state space, as well as the availability of RGB-D or RGB
data only, mean errors of as low as 11? could be achieved.}

Natural wings being fundamentally responsible for this phenomenon are developed over millions of years of evolution. Artificial wings on the other hand, are limited to the human-proposed conceptual design phase often leading to sub-optimal results. However, the novel Generative Design (GD) method claims to produce mechanically improved solutions based on robust and rigorous models of design conditions and performance criteria. This study investigates the potential applications of this Computer-Associated Design (CAsD) technology to generate novel micro aerial vehicle wing concepts that are structurally more stable and efficient. Multiple performance-driven solutions (wings) with high-level goals are generated by an infinite scale cloud computing solution executing a machine learning based GD algorithm. Ultimately, the highest performing CAsD concepts are numerically analysed, fabricated, and mechanically tested according to our previous study, and the results are compared to the literature for qualitative as well as quantitative analysis and validations. It was concluded that the GD-based tandem wings' (fore-\& hindwing) ability to withstand fracture failure without compromising structural rigidity was optimised by 78\% compared to its peer models. However, the weight was slightly increased by 11\% with 14\% drop in stiffness when compared to our models from previous study.}

We introduce a probability criterion based on the classical central limit theorem that allows evaluation of the likelihood that a data-point is drawn from U. This enables the labelling of the data on the fly. Non-anomalous data is passed to train a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder that distinguishes anomalies when the reconstruction error exceeds a threshold. To illustrate our algorithm?s efficacy, we consider two real industrial case studies where gradually-developing and abrupt anomalies occur. Moreover, we compare our algorithm?s performance with four of the recent and widely used algorithms in the domain.

The work presented here explores the application of market-based task allocation mechanisms to the problem of managing a heterogeneous human workforce to undertake activities associated with harvesting soft fruit. Soft fruit farms aim to maximise yield (the volume of fruit picked) while minimising labour time (and thus the cost of picking).

We propose a novel Batch Mode Active Learning that blends Region Convolutional Neural Network?s (RCNN) Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) levels together and employs t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) classi?cation for selecting incremental batch based on feature similarity. Later, K-means clustering is performed on t-SNE instances for the selected sample size of images. Results show that t-SNE classi?cation on merged FPN feature maps outperforms the approach based on RGB images directly, random sampling and maximum entropy-based image sampling schemes. For comparison, we employ a publicly available data set of images of Sugar beet for a crop-weed discrimination task together with our newly acquired annotated images of Romaine and Apollo lettuce crops at di?erent growth stages. Batch sampling on all datasets by the proposed method shows that only 60\% of images are required to produce precision/recall statistics similar to the complete dataset. Two lettuce datasets used in our experiments are publicly available (Lettuce datasets: https://bit.ly/3g7Owc5) to facilitate further research opportunities.}

        abstract = {Currently, collision detection methods based on visual cues are still challenged by several factors including ultrafast approaching velocity and noisy signal. Taking inspiration from nature, though the computational models of lobula giant
movement detectors (LGMDs) in locust?s visual pathways have demonstrated positive impacts on addressing these problems, there remains potential for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel method mimicking neuronal refractoriness, i.e. the refractory period (RP), and further investigate its functionality and efficacy in the classic LGMD neural network model for collision perception. Compared with previous works, the two phases constructing RP, namely the absolute refractory period (ARP) and relative refractory period (RRP) are computationally implemented through a ?link (L) layer? located between the photoreceptor and the excitation layers to realise the dynamic characteristic of RP in discrete time domain. The L layer, consisting of local time-varying thresholds, represents a sort of mechanism that allows photoreceptors to be activated individually and selectively by comparing the intensity of each photoreceptor to its corresponding local threshold established by its last output. More specifically, while the local threshold can merely be augmented by larger output, it shrinks exponentially over time. Our experimental outcomes show that, to some extent, the investigated mechanism not only enhances the LGMD model in terms of reliability and stability when faced with ultra-fast approaching objects, but also improves its performance against visual stimuli polluted by Gaussian or Salt-Pepper noise. This research demonstrates the modelling of refractoriness is effective in collision perception neuronal models, and promising to address the aforementioned collision detection challenges.}

        abstract = {Screening via low-dose Computer Tomography (CT) has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality rates by at least 20\%. However, the assessment of large numbers of CT scans by radiologists is cost intensive, and potentially produces varying and inconsistent results for differing radiologists (and also for temporally-separated assessments by the same radiologist). To overcome these challenges, computer aided diagnosis systems based on deep learning methods have proved effective in automatic detection and classification of lung cancer. Latterly, interest has focused on the full utilization of the 3D information in CT scans using 3D-CNNs and related approaches. However, such approaches do not intrinsically correlate size and shape information between slices. In this work, an innovative approach Multi-view Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (MV-CRecNet) is proposed that exploits shape, size and cross-slice variations while learning to identify lung cancer nodules from CT scans. The multiple-views that are passed to the model ensure better generalization and the learning of robust features. We evaluate the proposed MV-CRecNet model on the reference Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative and Early Lung Cancer Action Program datasets; six evaluation metrics are applied to eleven comparison models for testing. Results demonstrate that proposed methodology outperforms all of the models against all of the evaluation metrics.}

        abstract = {This article presents an efficient fingerprint identification system that implements an initial classification for search-space reduction followed by minutiae neighbor-based feature encoding and matching. The current state-of-the-art fingerprint classification methods use a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to assign confidence for the classification prediction, and based on this prediction, the input fingerprint is matched with only the subset of the database that belongs to the predicted class. It can be observed for the DCNNs that as the architectures deepen, the farthest layers of the network learn more abstract information from the input images that result in higher prediction accuracies. However, the downside is that the DCNNs are data hungry and require lots of annotated (labeled) data to learn generalized network parameters for deeper layers. In this article, a shallow multifeature view CNN (SMV-CNN) fingerprint classifier is proposed that extracts: 1) fine-grained features from the input image and 2) abstract features from explicitly derived representations obtained from the input image. The multifeature views are fed to a fully connected neural network (NN) to compute a global classification prediction. The classification results show that the SMV-CNN demonstrated an improvement of 2.8\% when compared to baseline CNN consisting of a single grayscale view on an open-source database. Moreover, in comparison with the state-of-the-art residual network (ResNet-50) image classification model, the proposed method performs comparably while being less complex and more efficient during training. The result of classification-based fingerprint identification has shown that the search space is reduced by over 50\% without degradation of identification accuracies.}

However, one of its main limitations is the need for carefully hand-coded reward signals by an expert. We argue that it is crucial to automate the reward learning process so that new skills can be taught to robots by their users. To address such automation, we consider task success classifiers using visual observations to estimate the rewards in terms of task success. In this work, we study the performance of multiple state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms under different types of reward: Dense, Sparse, Visual Dense, and Visual Sparse rewards. Our experiments in various simulation tasks (Pendulum, Reacher, Pusher, and Fetch Reach) show that while DRL agents can learn successful behaviours using visual rewards when the goal targets are distinguishable, their performance may decrease if the task goal is not clearly visible. Our results also show that visual dense rewards are more successful than visual sparse rewards and that there is no single best algorithm for all tasks.}

Deception has been widely studied within the fields of philosophy, psychology, economics and political science. Yet, we still lack an understanding of how deception emerges in a society under competitive (evolutionary) pressures. This paper begins to fill this gap by bridging evolutionary models of social good--public goods games (PGGs)--with ideas from Interpersonal Deception Theory and Truth-Default Theory. This provides a well-founded analysis of the growth of deception in societies and the effectiveness of several approaches to reducing deception. Assuming that knowledge is a public good, we use extensive simulation studies to explore (i) how deception impacts the sharing and dissemination of knowledge in societies over time, (ii) how different types of knowledge sharing societies are affected by deception, and (iii) what type of policing and regulation is needed to reduce the negative effects of deception in knowledge sharing. Our results indicate that cooperation in knowledge sharing can be re-established in systems by introducing institutions that investigate and regulate both defection and deception using a decentralised case-by-case strategy. This provides evidence for the adoption of methods for reducing the use of deception in the world around us in order to avoid a Tragedy of The Digital Commons.}

Taking inspiration from biological organisms? such as octopus tentacles and elephant trunks, soft robots commonly use elastic materials and novel actuation methods to mimic the continuous deformation of their mostly soft bodies. While current robotic manipulators, such as those used in the DaVinci surgical robot, have seen use in precise minimally invasive surgeries applications, the capability of soft robotics to provide a greater degree of flexibility and inherently safe interactions shows great promise that motivates further study. Nevertheless, introducing softness consequently opens new challenges in achieving accurate positional control and sufficient force generation often required for manipulation tasks. In this paper, the feasibility of a stiffening mechanism based on tendon-twisting is investigated, as an alternative stiffening mechanism for soft actuators that can be easily scaled as needed based on tendon size, material properties, and arrangements, while offering simple means of controlling a gradual increase in stiffening during operation.}

By embedding SILs in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), we establish a novel agricultural Internet of Things (IoT), referred to as the SILIoTs. In practice, the deployment of SIL nodes is determined by the geographical characteristics of an actual farmland, the constraints on the locations of SIL nodes, and the radio-wave propagation in complex agricultural environment. In this paper, we mainly focus on the constrained SIL Deployment Problem (cSILDP) in a mixed-crop farmland, where the locations used to deploy SIL nodes are a limited set of candidates located on the ridges. We formulate the cSILDP in this scenario as a Connected Set Cover (CSC) problem, and propose a Hole Aware Node Deployment Method (HANDM) based on the greedy algorithm to solve the constrained optimization problem. The HANDM is a two-phase method. In the first phase, a novel deployment strategy is utilised to guarantee only a single coverage hole in each iteration, based on which a set of suboptimal locations is found for the deployment of SIL nodes. In the second phase, according to the operations of deletion and fusion, the optimal locations are obtained to meet the requirements on complete coverage and connectivity. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better performance than the peer algorithms, specifically in terms of deployment cost.}

These schemes provide a mechanism for capturing clinical reasoning in such a way that it can be handled by the formal reasoning mechanisms of formal argumentation.

been studied and modelled intensively, their capability and robustness against real-time
critical traffic scenarios where real-physical crashes will happen have never been
systematically investigated due to difficulty and high price in replicating risky traffic with
many crash occurrences. To close this gap, we apply a recently published robotic platform
to test the LGMDs inspired visual systems in physical implementation of critical traffic
scenarios at low cost and high flexibility. The proposed visual systems are applied as the
only collision sensing modality in each micro-mobile robot to conduct avoidance by abrupt
braking. The simulated traffic resembles on-road sections including the intersection and
highway scenes wherein the roadmaps are rendered by coloured, artificial pheromones
upon a wide LCD screen acting as the ground of an arena. The robots with light sensors at
bottom can recognise the lanes and signals, tightly follow paths. The emphasis herein is
laid on corroborating the robustness of LGMDs neural systems model in different dynamic
robot scenes to timely alert potential crashes. This study well complements previous
experimentation on such bio-inspired computations for collision prediction in more critical
physical scenarios, and for the first time demonstrates the robustness of LGMDs inspired
visual systems in critical traffic towards a reliable collision alert system under constrained
computation power. This paper also exhibits a novel, tractable, and affordable robotic
approach to evaluate online visual systems in dynamic scenes.}

        abstract = {MusicHastie is a hierarchical music representation language designed for use in human and automated composition and for human and machine learning based music study and analysis. It represents and manipulates musical structure in a semantic form based on concepts from Schenkerian analysis, western European art music and popular music notations, electronica and some non-western forms such as modes and ragas. The representation is designed to model one form of musical perception by human musicians so can be used to aid human understanding and memorization of popular music pieces. An open source MusicHastie to MIDI compiler is released as part of this publication, now including capabilities for electronica MIDI control commands to model structures such as filter sweeps in addition to keys, chords, rhythms, patterns, and melodies.}

A classifier model assessing the quality of actions can predict the successful completion of a task, which can be used by intelligent agents for action-selection. This paper presents a novel classifier that learns to classify task completion only from a few demonstrations. We carry out a comprehensive comparison of different neural classifiers, e.g. fully connected-based, fully convolutional-based, sequence2sequence-based, and domain adaptation-based classification. We also present a new dataset including five robot manipulation tasks, which is publicly available. We compared the performances of our novel classifier and the existing models using our dataset and the MIME dataset. The results suggest domain adaptation and timing-based features improve success prediction. Our novel model, i.e. fully convolutional neural network with domain adaptation and timing features, achieves an average classification accuracy of 97.3\% and 95.5\% across tasks in both datasets whereas state-of-the-art classifiers without domain adaptation and timing-features only achieve 82.4\% and 90.3\%, respectively.}

        abstract = {Currently, greenhouses are widely applied for plant growth, and environmental parameters can also be controlled in the modern greenhouse to guarantee the maximum crop yield. In order to optimally control greenhouses? environmental parameters, one indispensable requirement is to accurately predict crop yields based on given environmental parameter settings. In addition, crop yield forecasting in greenhouses plays an important role in greenhouse farming planning and management, which allows cultivators and farmers to utilize the yield prediction results to make knowledgeable management and financial decisions. It is thus important to accurately predict the crop yield in a greenhouse considering the benefits that can be brought by accurate greenhouse crop yield prediction. In this work, we have developed a new greenhouse crop yield prediction technique, by combining two state-of-the-arts networks for temporal sequence processing{--}temporal convolutional network (TCN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). Comprehensive evaluations of the proposed algorithm have been made on multiple datasets obtained from multiple real greenhouse sites for tomato growing. Based on a statistical analysis of the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the predicted and actual crop yields, it is shown that the proposed approach achieves more accurate yield prediction performance than both traditional machine learning methods and other classical deep neural networks. Moreover, the experimental study also shows that the historical yield information is the most important factor for accurately predicting future crop yields.}

They achieve it by high-performance wing structures evolved over millions of years in nature. Among other prehistoric beings, locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is a perfect example of such natural glider capable of endured transatlantic flights that could inspire a practical solution to achieve similar capabilities on micro aerial vehicles. This study investigates the effects of haemolymph on the flexibility of several flying insect wings further showcasing the superior structural performance of locusts.
However, biomimicry of such aerodynamic and structural properties is hindered by the limitations of modern as well as conventional fabrication technologies in terms of availability and precision, respectively. Therefore, here we adopt finite element analysis (FEA) to investigate the manufacturing-worthiness of a 3D digitally reconstructed locust tandem wing, and propose novel combinations of economical and readily-available manufacturing methods to develop the model into prototypes that are structurally similar to their counterparts in nature while maintaining the optimum gliding ratio previously obtained in the aerodynamic simulations. Latter is evaluated in the future study and the former is assessed here via an experimental analysis of the flexural stiffness and maximum deformation rate.
Ultimately, a comparative study of the mechanical properties reveals the feasibility of each prototype for gliding micro aerial vehicle applications.}

The presented Cloud-based Complaints Management and Decision Support System for Sustainable Farming in Egypt, named as AgroSupportAnalytics, aims to resolve the problem of both the lack of support and advice for farmers, and the inconsistencies in doing so by current manual approach provided by agricultural experts. Key contribution is the development of an automated complaint management and decision support strategy, on the basis of extensive research on requirement analysis tailored for Egypt. The solution is grounded on the application of knowledge discovery and analysis on agricultural data and farmers? complaints, deployed on a Cloud platform, to provide farming stakeholders in Egypt with timely and suitable support. This paper presents the overall system architectural framework along with the information and storage services, which have been based on the requirements specifications phases of the project along with the historical data sets of past 10�year of farmers complaints and enquiries in Egypt.}

In most IoT-based systems, especially those within smart-homes and smart-cities, there is a bridging point (fog computing) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks, as well as small amounts of data processing. The fog nodes can have useful knowledge and potential for constructive security and control over both the sensor network and the data transmitted over the Internet. Smart healthcare services utilise such networks of IoT systems. It is therefore vital that medical data emanating from IoT systems is highly secure, to prevent fraudulent use, whilst maintaining quality of service providing assured, verified and complete data. In this article, we examine the development of a Cognitive Fog (CF) model, for secure, smart healthcare services, that is able to make decisions such as opting-in and opting-out from running processes and invoking new processes when required, and providing security for the operational processes within the fog system. Overall, the proposed ensemble security model performed better in terms of Accuracy Rate, Detection Rate, and a lower False Positive Rate (standard intrusion detection measurements) than three base classifiers (K-NN, DBSCAN, and DT) using a standard security dataset (NSL-KDD).}

URANOS neutron scattering simulations are used to show that 5 cm of additional HDPE moderator (used to shield the upper surface and sides of the detector) is sufficient to (i), reduce the footprint of the detector considerably, (ii) approximately double the percentage of neutrons detected from within 5 m of the detector, and (iii), does not affect the shape of the curve used to convert neutron counts into soil moisture. Simulation and rover measurements for a transect crossing between grass and concrete additionally suggest that (iv), soil moisture changes can be sensed over a length scales of tens of meters or less (roughly an order of magnitude smaller than commonly used footprint distances), and (v), the additional moderator does not reduce the detected neutron count rate (and hence increase noise) as much as might be expected given the extent of the additional moderator. The detector with additional HDPE moderator was also used to conduct measurements on a stubble field over three weeks to test the rover system in measuring spatial and temporal soil moisture variation.}

        abstract = {Soft robotic grippers are increasingly desired in applications that involve grasping of complex and deformable objects. However, their flexible nature and non-linear dynamics makes the modelling and control difficult. Numerical techniques such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) present an accurate way of modelling complex deformations. However, FEA approaches are computationally expensive and consequently challenging to employ for real-time control tasks. Existing analytical techniques simplify the modelling by approximating the deformed gripper geometry. Although this approach is less computationally demanding, it is limited in design scope and can lead to larger estimation errors. In this paper, we present a learning based framework that is able to predict contact forces as well as stress distribution from soft Fin Ray Effect (FRE) finger images in real-time. These images are used to learn internal representations for deformations using a deep neural encoder, which are further decoded to contact forces and stress maps using separate branches. The entire network is jointly learned in an end-to-end fashion. In order to address the challenge of having sufficient labelled data for training, we employ FEA to generate simulated images to supervise our framework. This leads to an accurate prediction, faster inference and availability of large and diverse data for better generalisability. Furthermore, our approach is able to predict a detailed stress distribution that can guide grasp planning, which would be particularly useful for delicate objects. Our proposed approach is validated by comparing the predicted contact forces to the computed ground-truth forces from FEA as well as real force sensor. We rigorously evaluate the performance of our approach under variations in contact point, object material, object shape, viewing angle, and level of occlusion.}

empirically examines pedestrian behaviour during road crossing in the presence of approaching autonomous
vehicles in more realistic virtual reality (VR) environments. The autonomous vehicles are controlled using game
theory, and this study seeks to find the best parameters for these controls to produce comfortable interactions
for the pedestrians. In a first experiment, participants? trajectories reveal a more cautious crossing behaviour in
VR than in previous laboratory experiments. In two further experiments, a gradient descent approach is used to
investigate participants? preference for AV driving style. The results show that the majority of participants were
not expecting the AV to stop in some scenarios, and there was no change in their crossing behaviour in two
environments and with different car models suggestive of car and last-mile style vehicles. These results provide
some initial estimates for game theoretic parameters needed by future AVs in their pedestrian interactions and
more generally show how such parameters can be inferred from virtual reality experiments.}

To decide what to use, we compared three methods for counting fruit and grains, each method representative of a class of approaches from the literature. These are two methods based on density estimation and regression (single and multiple column), and one method based on object detection. We found that when the density of objects in an image is low, the approaches are comparable, but as the density increases, counting by regression becomes steadily more accurate than counting by detection. With more than a hundred objects per image, the error in the count predicted by detection-based methods is up to 5 times higher than when using regression-based ones.}

Furthermore, the suitability of a premium everbearer strawberry cultivar with a high yield potential was compared with a standard winter glasshouse June-bearer cultivar currently used for out-of-season production in the UK. Three lighting durations (11, 16 and 22 h) provided by LEDs were combined with two light intensities (344 and 227 ?mol) to give six light treatments on each tier of a three-tiered system to grow the two cultivars. The everbearer showed a higher yield with a higher correlation with increased lighting and a greater proportion of reproductive growth than the Junebearer. Light intensity and duration increased yield with duration also increasing sugar content (?Brix). However, even with yields of over 100 t ha?1 recorded in this study, yields are likely to be insufficient to cover the cost of electricity.}

In this article, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer approach that automatically induces a hierarchy of ?generation spaces? from a dataset of semantic concepts and texts. Generation spaces are based on a notion of similarity of partial knowledge graphs that represent the domain and feed into a hierarchy of sequence-to-sequence or memory-to-sequence learners for concept-to-text generation. An advantage of our approach is that learning models are exposed to the most relevant examples during training which can avoid bias towards majority samples. We evaluate our approach on two common benchmark datasets and compare our hierarchical approach against a flat learning setup. We also conduct a comparison between sequence-to-sequence and memory-to-sequence learning models. Experiments show that our hierarchical approach overcomes issues of data sparsity and learns robust lexico-syntactic patterns, consistently outperforming flat baselines and previous work by up to 30\%. We also find that while memory-to-sequence models can outperform sequence-to-sequence models in some cases, the latter are generally more stable in their performance and represent a safer overall choice.}

Consequently, it can be deduced that locomotion strategies must have evolved from one environment to the other. However, the mechanism by which this transition happened and its implications on bio-mechanical studies and robotics research have not been explored in detail. This paper presents a unifying control strategy for locomotion in varying environments based on the principle of ?learning to stop?. Using a common reinforcement learning framework, deep deterministic policy gradient, we show that our proposed learning strategy facilitates a fast and safe methodology for transferring learned controllers from the facile water environment to the harsh land environment. Our results not only propose a plausible mechanism for safe and quick transition of locomotion strategies from a water to land environment but also provide a novel alternative for safer and faster training of robots.}

Automatic and accurate disease lesion segmentation enables fast evaluation of disease severity and assessment of disease progress. In tasks requiring computer vision, deep learning has recently gained tremendous success for image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. To test whether we could extract late blight lesions from unstructured field environments based on high-resolution visual field images and deep learning algorithms, we collected{$\sim$}500 field RGB images in a set of diverse potato genotypes with different disease severity (0\%?70\%), resulting in 2100 cropped images. 1600 of these cropped images were used as the dataset for training deep neural networks and 250 cropped images were randomly selected as the validation dataset. Finally, the developed model was tested on the remaining 250 cropped images. The results show that the values for intersection over union (IoU) of the classes background (leaf and soil) and disease lesion in the test dataset were 0.996 and 0.386, respectively. Furthermore, we established a linear relationship (R2=0.655) between manual visual scores of late blight and the number of lesions detected by deep learning at the canopy level. We also showed that imbalance weights of lesion and background classes improved segmentation performance, and that fused masks based on the majority voting of the multiple masks enhanced the correlation with the visual disease scores. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using deep learning algorithms for disease lesion segmentation and severity evaluation based on proximal imagery, which could aid breeding for crop resistance in field environments, and also benefit precision farming.}

        abstract = {To date, the research on agriculture vehicles in general and Agriculture Mobile Robots (AMRs) in particular has focused on a single vehicle (robot) and its agriculture-specific capabilities. Very little work has explored the coordination of fleets of such vehicles in the daily execution of farming tasks. This is especially the case when considering overall fleet performance, its efficiency and scalability in the context of highly automated agriculture vehicles that perform tasks throughout multiple fields potentially owned by different farmers and/or enterprises. The potential impact of automating AMR fleet coordination on commercial agriculture is immense. Major conglomerates with large and heterogeneous fleets of agriculture vehicles could operate on huge land areas without human operators to effect precision farming. In this paper, we propose the Agriculture Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem (AF-VRP) which, to the best of our knowledge, differs from any other version of the Vehicle Routing Problem studied so far. We focus on the dynamic and decentralised version of this problem applicable in environments involving multiple agriculture machinery and farm owners where concepts of fairness and equity must be considered. Such a problem combines three related problems: the dynamic assignment problem, the dynamic 3-index assignment problem and the capacitated arc routing problem. We review the state-of-the-art and categorise solution approaches as centralised, distributed and decentralised, based on the underlining decision-making context. Finally, we discuss open challenges in applying distributed and decentralised coordination approaches to this problem.}

However, picking fruits in a dense cluster imposes a challenging research question in terms of motion/path planning as conventional planning approaches may not find collision-free movements for the robot to reach-and-pick a ripe fruit within a dense cluster. In such cases, the robot needs to safely push unripe fruits to reach a ripe one. Nonetheless, existing approaches to planning pushing movements in cluttered environments either are computationally expensive or only deal with 2-D cases and are not suitable for fruit picking, where it needs to compute 3- D pushing movements in a short time. In this work, we present a path planning algorithm for pushing occluding fruits to reach-and-pick a ripe one. Our proposed approach, called Interactive Probabilistic Movement Primitives (I-ProMP), is not computationally expensive (its computation time is in the order of 100 milliseconds) and is readily used for 3-D problems. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach with pushing unripe strawberries in a simulated polytunnel. Our experimental results confirm I-ProMP successfully pushes table top grown strawberries and reaches a ripe one.}

We present a new methodology for benchmarking of pedestrian flow models based on the afforded safety of robot navigation in human-populated environments. While previous evaluations of pedestrian flow models focused on their predictive capabilities, we assess their ability to support safe path planning and scheduling. Using real-world datasets gathered continuously over several weeks, we benchmark state-of-theart pedestrian flow models, including both time-averaged and time-sensitive models. In the evaluation, we use the learned models to plan robot trajectories and then observe the number of times when the robot gets too close to humans, using a predefined social distance threshold. The experiments show that while traditional evaluation criteria based on model fidelity differ only marginally, the introduced criteria vary significantly depending on the model used, providing a natural interpretation of the expected safety of the system. For the time-averaged flow models, the number of encounters increases linearly with the percentage operating time of the robot, as might be reasonably expected. By contrast, for the time-sensitive models, the number of encounters grows sublinearly with the percentage operating time, by planning to avoid congested areas and times.}

        abstract = {For robots to navigate successfully in the real world, unstructured environment adaptability is a prerequisite. Although this is typically implemented within the control layer, there have been recent proposals of adaptation through a morphing of the body. However, the successful demonstration of this approach has mostly been theoretical and in simulations thus far. In this work we present an underwater hopping robot that features a deformable body implemented as a deployable structure that is covered by a soft skin for which it is possible to manually change the body size without altering any other property (e.g. buoyancy or weight). For such a system, we show that it is possible to induce a stable hopping behavior instead of a fall, by just increasing the body size. We provide a mathematical model that describes the hopping behavior of the robot under the influence of shape-dependent underwater contributions (drag, buoyancy, and added mass) in order to analyze and compare the results obtained. Moreover, we show that for certain conditions, a stable hopping behavior can only be obtained through changing the morphology of the robot as the controller (i.e. actuator) would already be working at maximum capacity. The presented work demonstrates that, through the exploitation of shape-dependent forces, the dynamics of a system can be modified through altering the morphology of the body to induce a desirable behavior and, thus, a morphological change can be an effective alternative to the classic control.}

        abstract = {Haptics provides a natural and intuitive channel of communication during the interaction of two humans in complex physical tasks, such as joint object transportation. However, despite the utmost importance of touch in physical interactions, the use of haptics is underrepresented when developing intelligent systems. This study explores the prominence of haptic data to extract information about underlying interaction patterns within human-human cooperation. For this purpose, we design salient haptic features describing the collaboration quality within a physical dyadic task and investigate the use of these features to classify the interaction patterns. We categorize the interaction into four discrete behavior classes. These classes describe whether the partners work in harmony or face conflicts while jointly transporting an object through translational or rotational movements. We test the proposed features on a physical human-human interaction (pHHI) dataset, consisting of data collected from 12 human dyads. Using these data, we verify the salience of haptic features by achieving a correct classification rate over 91\% using a Random Forest classifier.}

For this reason, flagella are an interesting case study in soft robotics and they represent an appealing source of inspiration for the design of underwater robots. A great number of flagellum-inspired devices exists, but these are all characterized by a size ranging in the micrometer scale and mostly realized with rigid materials. Here, we present the design and development of a novel generation of macroscale underwater propellers that draw their inspiration from flagellated organisms. Through a simple rotatory actuation and exploiting the capability of the soft material to store energy when interacting with the surrounding fluid, the propellers attain different helical shapes that generate a propulsive thrust. A theoretical model is presented, accurately describing and predicting the kinematic and the propulsive capabilities of the proposed solution. Different experimental trials are presented to validate the accuracy of the model and to investigate the performance of the proposed design. Finally, an underwater robot prototype propelled by four flagellar modules is presented.}

        abstract = {Salinization represents a global threat to agricultural productivity and human livelihoods. Historically, much saline research has focussed on arid or semi-arid systems. The North Sea region of Europe has seen very little attention in salinity literature, however, under future climate predictions, this is likely to change. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of salinization across the North Sea region. These include the intrusion of saline groundwater, coastal flooding, irrigation and airborne salinization. The extent of each degradation process is explored for the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. The potential threat of salinization across the North Sea varies in a complex and diverse manner. However, we find an overall lack of data, both of water monitoring and soil sampling, on salinity in the region. For agricultural systems in the region to adapt against future salinization risk, more extensive mapping and monitoring of salinization need to be conducted, along with the development of appropriate land management practices.}

We evaluated the following SLAM systems: LIO-SAM, StaticMapping, ORB-SLAM2, and RTAB-MAP in four different scenarios. The mobile robot used in this study is equipped with 2D and 3D lidars, IMU, and RGB-D camera (Kinect v2). The results show good and encouraging performance of RTAB-MAP in such an environment.}

Adoption of DSS is challenging when such systems lack support, or evidence, for justifying their recommendations. DSSs are widely applied in the medical domain, due to the complexity of the domain and the sheer volume of  data that render manual processing difficult. This paper proposes a metalevel argumentation-based decision-support system that can reason with heterogeneous data (e.g. body measurements, electronic health records, clinical guidelines), while incorporating the preferences of the human beneficiaries of those decisions. The system constructs template-based explanations for the recommendations that it makes. The proposed framework has been implemented in a system to support stroke patients and its functionality has been tested in a pilot study. User feedback shows that the system can run effectively over an extended period.}

        abstract = {Discriminating small moving objects within complex visual environments is a significant challenge for autonomous micro robots that are generally limited in computational power. By exploiting their highly evolved visual systems, flying insects can effectively detect mates and track prey during rapid pursuits, even though the small targets equate to only a few pixels in their visual field. The high degree of sensitivity to small target movement is supported by a class of specialized neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs). Existing STMD-based computational models normally comprise four sequentially arranged neural layers interconnected via feedforward loops to extract information on small target motion from raw visual inputs. However, feedback, another important regulatory circuit for motion perception, has not been investigated in the STMD pathway and its functional roles for small target motion detection are not clear. In this paper, we propose an STMD-based neural network with feedback connection (Feedback STMD), where the network output is temporally delayed, then fed back to the lower layers to mediate neural responses. We compare the properties of the model with and without the time-delay feedback loop, and find it shows preference for high-velocity objects. Extensive experiments suggest that the Feedback STMD achieves superior detection performance for fast-moving small targets, while significantly suppressing background false positive movements which display lower velocities. The proposed feedback model provides an effective solution in robotic visual systems for detecting fast-moving small targets that are always salient and potentially threatening.}

        abstract = {Collision detection is one of the most challenging tasks for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This is especially true for small or micro UAVs, due to their limited computational power. In nature, flying insects with compact and simple visual systems demonstrate their remarkable ability to navigate and avoid collision in complex environments. A good example of this is provided by locusts. They can avoid collisions in a dense swarm through the activity of a motion-based visual neuron called the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD). The defining feature of the LGMD neuron is its preference for looming. As a flying insect?s visual neuron, LGMD is considered to be an ideal basis for building UAV?s collision detecting system. However, existing LGMD models cannot distinguish looming clearly from other visual cues such as complex background movements caused by UAV agile flights. To address this issue, we proposed a new model implementing distributed spatial-temporal synaptic interactions, which is inspired by recent findings in locusts? synaptic morphology. We first introduced the locally distributed excitation to enhance the excitation caused by visual motion with preferred velocities. Then radially extending temporal latency for inhibition is incorporated to compete with the distributed excitation and selectively suppress the non-preferred visual motions. This spatial-temporal competition between excitation and inhibition in our model is therefore tuned to preferred image angular velocity representing looming rather than background movements with these distributed synaptic interactions. Systematic experiments have been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed model for UAV agile flights. The results have demonstrated that this new model enhances the looming selectivity in complex flying scenes considerably, and has the potential to be implemented on embedded collision detection systems for small or micro UAVs.}
