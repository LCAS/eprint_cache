Understanding the underlying characteristics and functionality of insects' visual systems is not only attractive to neural system modellers but also critical in providing effective solutions to future robotics. This paper presents a novel modelling of dynamic vision system inspired by Drosophila physiology for mimicking fast motion tracking and a closed-loop behavioural response to fixation. The proposed model was realised on the embedded system in an autonomous micro robot which has limited computational resources. A monocular camera was applied as the only motion sensing modality. Systematic experiments including open-loop and closed-loop bio-robotic tests validated the proposed visual fixation model: the robot showed motion tracking and fixation behaviours similarly to insects; the image processing frequency can maintain 25 45Hz. Arena tests also demonstrated a successful following behaviour aroused by fixation in navigation.},

    abstract = {Exploiting robots for activities in human-shared environments, whether warehouses, shopping centres or hospitals, calls for such robots to understand the underlying physical interactions between nearby agents and objects. In particular, modelling cause-and-effect relations between the latter can help to predict unobserved human behaviours and anticipate the outcome of specific robot interventions. In this paper, we propose an application of causal discovery methods to model human-robot spatial interactions, trying to understand human behaviours from real-world sensor data in two possible scenarios: humans interacting with the environment, and humans interacting with obstacles. New methods and practical solutions are discussed to exploit, for the first time, a state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithm in some challenging human environments, with potential application in many service robotics scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of the causal models obtained from real-world datasets, we present a comparison between causal and non-causal prediction approaches. Our results show that the causal model correctly captures the underlying interactions of the considered scenarios and improves its prediction accuracy.},

    abstract = {Reasoning on the context of human beings is crucial for many real-world applications especially for those deploying autonomous systems (e.g. robots). In this paper, we present a new approach for context reasoning to further advance the field of human motion prediction. We therefore propose a neuro-symbolic approach for human motion prediction (NeuroSyM), which weights differently the interactions in the neighbourhood by leveraging an intuitive technique for spatial representation called Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC). The proposed approach is experimentally tested on medium and long term time horizons using two architectures from the state of art, one of which is a baseline for human motion prediction and the other is a baseline for generic multivariate time-series prediction. Six datasets of challenging crowded scenarios, collected from both fixed and mobile cameras, were used for testing. Experimental results show that the NeuroSyM approach outperforms in most cases the baseline architectures in terms of prediction accuracy.},

    abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) must interact with other road users. They must understand and adapt to complex pedestrian behaviour, especially during crossings where priority is not clearly defined. This includes feedback effects such as modelling a pedestrian’s likely behaviours resulting from changes in the AVs behaviour. For example, whether a pedestrian will yield if the AV accelerates, and vice versa. To enable such automated interactions, it is necessary for the AV to possess a statistical model of the pedestrian’s responses to its own actions. A previous work demonstrated a proof-ofconcept method to fit parameters to a simplified model based on data from a highly artificial discrete laboratory task with human subjects. The method was based on LIDAR-based person tracking, game theory, and Gaussian process analysis. The present study extends this method to enable analysis of more realistic continuous human experimental data. It shows for the first time how game-theoretic predictive parameters can be fit into pedestrians natural and continuous motion during road-crossings, and how predictions can be made about their interactions with AV controllers in similar real-world settings.},

@article{11577_3455200_Distributed_Presynaptic_Connections,
    abstract = {Collision detection is one of the most challenging tasks for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This is especially true for small or micro-UAVs due to their limited computational power. In nature, flying insects with compact and simple visual systems demonstrate their remarkable ability to navigate and avoid collision in complex environments. A good example of this is provided by locusts. They can avoid collisions in a dense swarm through the activity of a motion-based visual neuron called the Lobula giant movement detector (LGMD). The defining feature of the LGMD neuron is its preference for looming. As a flying insect's visual neuron, LGMD is considered to be an ideal basis for building UAV's collision detecting system. However, existing LGMD models cannot distinguish looming clearly from other visual cues, such as complex background movements caused by UAV agile flights. To address this issue, we proposed a new model implementing distributed spatial-temporal synaptic interactions, which is inspired by recent findings in locusts' synaptic morphology. We first introduced the locally distributed excitation to enhance the excitation caused by visual motion with preferred velocities. Then, radially extending temporal latency for inhibition is incorporated to compete with the distributed excitation and selectively suppress the nonpreferred visual motions. This spatial-temporal competition between excitation and inhibition in our model is, therefore, tuned to preferred image angular velocity representing looming rather than background movements with these distributed synaptic interactions. Systematic experiments have been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed model for UAV agile flights. The results have demonstrated that this new model enhances the looming selectivity in complex flying scenes considerably and has the potential to be implemented on embedded collision detection systems for small or micro-UAVs.},

    abstract = {Robots learning a new manipulation task from a small amount of demonstrations are increasingly demanded in different workspaces. A classifier model assessing the quality of actions can predict the successful completion of a task, which can be used by intelligent agents for action-selection. This paper presents a novel classifier that learns to classify task completion only from a few demonstrations. We carry out a comprehensive comparison of different neural classifiers, e.g. fully connected-based, fully convolutional-based, sequence2sequence-based, and domain adaptation-based classification. We also present a new dataset including five robot manipulation tasks, which is publicly available. We compared the performances of our novel classifier and the existing models using our dataset and the MIME dataset. The results suggest domain adaptation and timing-based features improve success prediction. Our novel model, i.e. fully convolutional neural network with domain adaptation and timing features, achieves an average classification accuracy of 97.3% and 95.5% across tasks in both datasets whereas state-of-the-art classifiers without domain adaptation and timing-features only achieve 82.4% and 90.3%, respectively.},

    abstract = {The ability to perceive traversable regions is a crucial prerequisite for truly autonomous mobile systems. In our previous work [8], we introduced P-SVM, a 3D LiDAR-based traversability analysis system that achieves real-time performance in CPU. However, by design P-SVM does not capture features other than geometric features, limiting its performance and generalizability to complex environments. In this work, we introduce an augmented point cloud descriptor that further improves the performance of P-SVM. By exploiting additional features extracted from remission and height information in the point cloud, our model is able to adapt robustly to strong scene changes. Additionally, in the proposed descriptor, remission radial distribution features are introduced to capture local information around keypoints. This addresses the limitation of P-SVM, which focuses only on global features within the cell. Our new P-SVM2 model demonstrates performance almost on par with state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods on the challenging SemanticKITTI [1] dataset in the traversability analysis task. Notably, P-SVM2 is real-time and relies solely on mobile-level CPUs. Moreover, surprising results have been obtained in robustness and generalizability experiments.},

    abstract = {Human re-identification is an important feature of domestic service robots, in particular for elderly monitoring and assistance, because it allows them to perform personalized tasks and human-robot interactions. However vision-based re- identification systems are subject to limitations due to human pose and poor lighting conditions. This paper presents a new re-identification method for service robots using thermal images. In robotic applications, as the number and size of thermal datasets is limited, it is hard to use approaches that require huge amount of training samples. We propose a re-identification system that can work using only a small amount of data. During training, we perform entropy-based sampling to obtain a thermal dictionary for each person. Then, a symbolic representation is produced by converting each video into sequences of dictionary elements. Finally, we train a classifier using this symbolic representation and geometric distribution within the new representation domain. The experiments are performed on a new thermal dataset for human re-identification, which includes various situations of human motion, poses and occlusion, and which is made publicly available for research purposes. The proposed approach has been tested on this dataset and its improvements over standard approaches have been demonstrated.},

They mostly reflect good recording conditions and therefore fail to account for the highly variable conditions the robot would have to work with in the field, e.g. when providing in-field logistic support for human fruit pickers as in our scenario. Existing work on Intention Recognition mostly labels plans or actions as intentions, but neither of those fully capture the extend of human intent. In this work, we argue for a holistic view on human Intention Recognition and propose a set of recording conditions, gestures and behaviors that better reflect the environment and conditions an agricultural robot might find itself in. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by means of evaluating two human detection methods: Bounding boxes and skeleton extraction.},

In this paper, we introduce a framework allowing a robot to learn a new 3D LiDAR-based human classifier from other sensors over time, taking advantage of a multisensor tracking system. The main innovation is the use of different detectors for existing sensors (i.e. RGB-D camera, 2D LiDAR) to train, online, a new 3D LiDAR-based human classifier based on a new "trajectory probability". Our framework uses this probability to check whether new detection belongs to a human trajectory, estimated by different sensors and/or detectors, and to learn a human classifier in a semi-supervised fashion. The framework has been implemented and tested on a real-world dataset collected by a mobile robot. We present experiments illustrating that our system is able to effectively learn from different sensors and from the environment, and that the performance of the 3D LiDAR-based human classification improves with the number of sensors/detectors used.},

@conference{11577_3373517_Realtime_Object_Detection,
    abstract = {Object detection plays a crucial role in the development of Electronic Travel Aids (ETAs), capable to guide a person with visual impairments towards a target object in an unknown indoor environment. In such a scenario, the object detector runs on a mobile device (e.g. smartphone) and needs to be fast, accurate, and, most importantly, lightweight. Nowadays, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have become the state-of-the-art solution for object detection tasks, with many works improving speed and accuracy by proposing new architectures or extending existing ones. A common strategy is to use deeper networks to get higher performance, but that leads to a higher computational cost which makes it impractical to integrate them on mobile devices with limited computational power. In this work we compare different object detectors to find a suitable candidate to be implemented on ETAs, focusing on lightweight models capable of working in real-time on mobile devices with a good accuracy. In particular, we select two models: SSD Lite with Mobilenet V2 and Tiny-DSOD. Both models have been tested on the popular OpenImage dataset and a new dataset, named L-CAS Office dataset, collected to further test models’ performance and robustness in a real scenario inspired by the actual perception challenges of a user with visual impairments.},
